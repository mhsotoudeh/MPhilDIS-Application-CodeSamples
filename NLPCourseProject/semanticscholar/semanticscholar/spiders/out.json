But can one find such a coloring via a sublinear algorithm? We answer this fundamental question in the affirmative for several canonical classes of sublinear algorithms including graph streaming, sublinear time, and massively parallel computation (MPC) algorithms. In particular, we design: \u2022 A single-pass semi-streaming algorithm in dynamic streams using \u00d5(n) space. The only known semi-streaming algorithm prior to our work was a folklore O(log n)-pass algorithm obtained by simulating classical distributed algorithms in the streaming model. \u2022 A sublinear-time algorithm in the standard query model that allows neighbor queries and pair queries using \u00d5(n \u221a n) time. We further show that any algorithm that outputs a valid coloring with sufficiently large constant probability requires \u03a9(n \u221a n) time. No non-trivial sublinear time algorithms were known prior to our work. \u2022 A parallel algorithm in the massively parallel computation (MPC) model using \u00d5(n) memory per machine and O(1) MPC rounds. Our number of rounds significantly improves upon the recent O(log log\u2206 \u00b7 log\u2217 (n))-round algorithm of Parter [ICALP 2018]. At the core of our results is a remarkably simple meta-algorithm for the (\u2206 + 1) coloring problem: Sample O(log n) colors for each vertex independently and uniformly at random from the \u2206+ 1 colors; find a proper coloring of the graph using only the sampled colors of each vertex.

The sublinear algorithms are then obtained by designing efficient algorithms for finding a proper coloring of the graph from the sampled colors in each model. We note that all our upper bound results for (\u2206 + 1) coloring are either optimal or close to best possible in each model studied. We also establish new lower bounds that rule out the possibility of achieving similar results in these models for the closely related problems of maximal independent set and maximal matching.

Energy savings and emissions reductions can be achieved by shifting freight to rail or water modes, both of which are far more energy efficient and emit far less CO2 per tonne-km than road. We briefly introduce five general strategies for decarbonizing freight transportation, and then focus on the literature and data relevant to estimating the global decarbonization potential through modal shift. We compare freight activity (in tonne-km) by mode for every country where data are available. We also describe major intraregional freight corridors, their modal structure, and their infrastructure needs. We find that the current world road and rail modal split is around 60:40, based on available data. Most countries are experiencing strong growth in road freight and a shift from rail to road. Rail intermodal transportation holds great potential for replacing carbon-intense and fast-growing road freight, but it is essential to have a targeted design of freight systems, particularly in developing countries. Modal shift can be promoted by policies targeting infrastructure investments and internalizing external costs of road freight, but we find that not many countries have such policies in place. We identify research needs for decarbonizing the freight transportation sector both through improvements in the efficiency of individual modes and through new physical and institutional infrastructure that can support modal shift.", "year": "2018", "authors": ["Lynn H.

[book review]", "abstract": "Climate change is a complex, multi-scale issue that needs to be discussed in the context of its social, ethical, environmental, economic and political drivers, impacts, and solutions. Drawdown is part of an emerging conversation that clearly identifies viable solutions while also asking difficult questions about finding our moral compass: What future do we want for humanity? How can wealth be shared more equitably? and How do we create a livable planet for humans and all biodiversity? The book is a compilation of credible, science-based solutions intended to halt and, more importantly, re verse human caused greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Hence the name \u201cDrawdown\u201d, something they say we need to embrace if we are to successfully prevent catastrophic impacts of climate change. The book avoids jargon and acronyms, providing a plain language, straightforward discussion of 80 possible solutions under the headings of Energy, Food, Women and Girls, Buildings and Cities, Land Use, Transport, and Materials. There are also 20 Coming Attractions recognizing this is a field of emerging solutions, some of which might work, others not. Nevertheless, there are serious efforts looking for solutions! Project Drawdown\u2019s long list of distinguished \u201cFellows\u201d and \u201cAdvisors\u201d (short biographies provided) have selected and ranked 80 viable climate solutions based on the number of gigatons of carbon dioxide they can reduce or remove in 30 years (2020 to 2050). You will be surprised at the top three solutions: 1. Refrigerant Management (CFCs and HCFCs are 1000 to 9000 times more potent than carbon dioxide as drivers of climate change, and air conditioning and refrigeration use is on the rise globally); 2. Wind Turbines \u2013 onshore (cited as now being the lowest cost source of new electrical capacity); and 3. Reduced Food Waste (efficiency reduces emissions associated with agriculture and food production and transportation, and increases carbon storage by preventing unnecessary deforestation). The numbers presented are said to be conservative estimates, recognizing the modelled scenarios could do even better with potential declining costs (e.g., solar panels), new technologies, and our willingness to in vest. For most solutions the \u201cnet cost\u201d of implementation (purchase, install, operate) and \u201cnet savings\u201d (based on the cost of the solution compared to following a \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d approach) over the 30 years of analysis are also presented. Cost effectiveness is highly variable and it is not linked to amount of GHG reduction: for solar farms there is a negative net cost of $80.6 billion (i.e., solar farms generate revenue as electricity is sold) and net savings of $5 023.8 billion over conventional electricity generation; for electric vehicles there is a net cost of $14 148.0 billion (people need to manufacture, purchase, and maintain cars) and net savings of $9 726.4 billion (i.e., it\u2019s cheaper to stick with conventional internal combustion engine cars). So there are both obvious smart choices (solar farms) and moral choices (consumer driven purchase of electric cars). (See http://www.drawdown.org for the data, analysis, and references associated with each solution.) Drawdown includes an array of topics presented as concise (2\u20134 page) discussions that will appeal to a wide audience. You can thumb through the book choosing interesting pieces or focus on specific areas. Did you know peatlands cover 3% of the earth\u2019s land surface and are second only to oceans in the amount of carbon they store! Drawdown also includes some re markable essays, such as an excerpt from Pope Francis\u2019 encyclical letter \u201con Care for our Common Home\u201d and an essay on food by Michael Pollan, author of The Omnivore\u2019s Dilemma. Drawdown is enlightening, it\u2019s not afraid to criticize itself, exposing data that are weak or probabilities of uptake might be low, and it gives climate change solutions the human dimension needed for us all to em brace the new ethos required to face the new climate world we have created for ourselves. Drawdown is highly recommended for those looking for hope that we will be able to face the challenges of the 21st century.", "year": "2017", "authors": ["Brent Tegler"], "refs": []},

This design choice goes directly against at least three key trends in systems that cause performance, scalability and energy bottlenecks: (1)\u00a0data access from memory is already a key bottleneck as applications become more data-intensive and memory bandwidth and energy do not scale well, (2)\u00a0energy consumption is a key constraint in especially mobile and server systems, (3)\u00a0data movement is very expensive in terms of bandwidth, energy and latency, much more so than computation. These trends are especially severely-felt in the data-intensive server and energy-constrained mobile systems of today. At the same time, conventional memory technology is facing many scaling challenges in terms of reliability, energy, and performance. As a result, memory system architects are open to organizing memory in different ways and making it more intelligent, at the expense of higher cost. The emergence of 3D-stacked memory plus logic as well as the adoption of error correcting codes inside DRAM chips, and the necessity for designing new solutions to serious reliability and security issues, such as the RowHammer phenomenon, are an evidence of this trend. In this work, we discuss some recent research that aims to practically enable computation close to data. After motivating trends in applications as well as technology, we discuss at least two promising directions for processing-in-memory (PIM): (1)\u00a0performing massively-parallel bulk operations in memory by exploiting the analog operational properties of DRAM, with low-cost changes, (2)\u00a0exploiting the logic layer in 3D-stacked memory technology to accelerate important data-intensive applications. In both approaches, we describe and tackle relevant cross-layer research, design, and adoption challenges in devices, architecture, systems, and programming models.

We introduce an abstract model of massively parallel computation, where essentially the only restrictions are that the \u201cfan-in\u201d of each machine is limited to s bits, where s is smaller than the input size\u00a0n, and that computation proceeds in synchronized rounds, with no communication between different machines within a round. Lower bounds on the round complexity of a problem in this model apply to every computing platform that shares the most basic design principles of MapReduce-type systems. We prove that computations in our model that use few rounds can be represented as low-degree polynomials over the reals. This connection allows us to translate a lower bound on the (approximate) polynomial degree of a Boolean function to a lower bound on the round complexity of every (randomized) massively parallel computation of that function. These lower bounds apply even in the \u201cunbounded width\u201d version of our model, where the number of machines can be arbitrarily large. As one example of our general results, computing any nontrivial monotone graph property\u2014such as connectivity\u2014requires a super-constant number of rounds when every machine receives only a subpolynomial (in n) number of input bits\u00a0s. Finally, we prove that, in two senses, our lower bounds are the best one could hope for. For the unbounded-width model, we prove a matching upper bound.

Prior work has shown significant performance improvements by using PIM for embarrassingly parallel and data-intensive applications, as well as for pointer-chasing traversals in sequential data structures. However, current server machines have hundreds of cores, and algorithms for concurrent data structures exploit these cores to achieve high throughput and scalability, with significant benefits over sequential data structures. Thus, it is important to examine how PIM performs with respect to modern concurrent data structures and understand how concurrent data structures can be developed to take advantage of PIM.\n This paper is the first to examine the design of concurrent data structures for PIM. We show two main results: (1) naive PIM data structures cannot outperform state-of-the-art concurrent data structures, such as pointer-chasing data structures and FIFO queues, (2) novel designs for PIM data structures, using techniques such as combining, partitioning and pipelining, can outperform traditional concurrent data structures, with a significantly simpler design.", "year": "2017", "authors": ["Zhiyu Liu", "Irina Calciu", "Maurice Herlihy", "Onur Mutlu"], "refs": ["https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Design-and-Evaluation-of-a-Processing-in-Memory-for-Azarkhish-Rossi/4ecba703c81a0df1d39370051616cf131536fa52", "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Fast-concurrent-queues-for-x86-processors-Morrison-Afek/33da45838d0b6c082cc71e603fd802bac4d56713", "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Flat-combining-and-the-synchronization-parallelism-Hendler-Incze/f5adefd72f0856fd750ace62bfee8d2a90db819c"]},

For this class of devices, energy efficiency is a first-class concern due to the limited battery capacity and thermal power budget. We find that data movement is a major contributor to the total system energy and execution time in consumer devices. The energy and performance costs of moving data between the memory system and the compute units are significantly higher than the costs of computation. As a result, addressing data movement is crucial for consumer devices. In this work, we comprehensively analyze the energy and performance impact of data movement for several widely-used Google consumer workloads: (1) the Chrome web browser; (2) TensorFlow Mobile, Google's machine learning framework; (3) video playback, and (4) video capture, both of which are used in many video services such as YouTube and Google Hangouts. We find that processing-in-memory (PIM) can significantly reduce data movement for all of these workloads, by performing part of the computation close to memory. Each workload contains simple primitives and functions that contribute to a significant amount of the overall data movement. We investigate whether these primitives and functions are feasible to implement using PIM, given the limited area and power constraints of consumer devices. Our analysis shows that offloading these primitives to PIM logic, consisting of either simple cores or specialized accelerators, eliminates a large amount of data movement, and significantly reduces total system energy (by an average of 55.4% across the workloads) and execution time (by an average of 54.2%).", "year": "2018", "authors": ["Amirali Boroumand", "Saugata Ghose", "Youngsok Kim", "Rachata Ausavarungnirun", "Eric Shiu", "Rahul Thakur", "Daehyun Kim", "Aki Kuusela", "Allan Knies", "Parthasarathy Ranganathan", "Onur Mutlu"], "refs": ["https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Lzo-real-time-data-compression-library-Oberhumer/682e4748743872b5a380087c950c8bee8875f64a", "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Very-Deep-Convolutional-Networks-for-Large-Scale-Simonyan-Zisserman/eb42cf88027de515750f230b23b1a057dc782108"]},

Even though these bulk data operations do not require any computation, current systems transfer a large quantity of data back and forth on the memory channel to perform such operations. As a result, bulk data operations consume high latency, bandwidth, and energy \u2014 degrading both system performance and energy efficiency. In this work, we propose RowClone, a new and simple mechanism to perform bulk copy and initialization completely within DRAM \u2014 eliminating the need to transfer any data over the memory channel to perform such operations. Our key observation is that DRAM can internally and efficiently transfer a large quantity of data (multiple KBs) between a row of DRAM cells and the associated row buffer. Based on this, our primary mechanism can quickly copy an entire row of data from a source row to a destination row by first copying the data from the source row to the row buffer and then from the row buffer to the destination row, via two back-to-back activate commands. This mechanism, which we call the Fast Parallel Mode of RowClone, reduces the latency and energy consumption of a 4KB bulk copy operation by 11.6\u00d7 and 74.4\u00d7, respectively, and a 4KB bulk zeroing operation by 6.0\u00d7 and 41.5\u00d7, respectively. To efficiently copy data between rows that do not share a row buffer, we propose a second mode of RowClone, the Pipelined Serial Mode, which uses the shared internal bus of a DRAM chip to quickly copy data between two banks.

The input graph in the Congested Clique model is a graph of n nodes, where each node initially knows only its incident edges. The communication graph is a clique with limited edge bandwidth: each two nodes (not necessarily neighbours in the input graph) can exchange $O(\\log n)$ bits. \nAs in previous works, the key part of the MST algorithm is an efficient Connected Components (CC) algorithm. However, unlike the former approaches, we do not aim at simulating the standard Boruvka algorithm, at least at initial stages of the CC algorithm. Instead, we develop a new technique which combines connected components of sample sparse subgraphs of the input graph in order to accelerate the process of uncovering connected components of the original input graph. More specifically, we develop a sparsification technique which reduces an initial CC problem in $O(1)$ rounds to its two restricted instances. The former instance has a graph with maximal degree $O(\\log \\log n)$ as the input -- here our sample-combining technique helps. In the latter instance, a partition of the input graph into $O(n/\\log \\log n)$ connected components is known. This gives an opportunity to apply previous algorithms to determine connected components in $O(1)$ rounds. \nOur result addresses the problem from and the $O(\\log \\log n)$ algorithm of Lotker et al.

In particular, large-scale graph processing is gaining attention due to its broad applicability from social science to machine learning. However, scalable hardware design that can efficiently process large graphs in main memory is still an open problem. Ideally, cost-effective and scalable graph processing systems can be realized by building a system whose performance increases proportionally with the sizes of graphs that can be stored in the system, which is extremely challenging in conventional systems due to severe memory bandwidth limitations. In this work, we argue that the conventional concept of processing-in-memory (PIM) can be a viable solution to achieve such an objective. The key modern enabler for PIM is the recent advancement of the 3D integration technology that facilitates stacking logic and memory dies in a single package, which was not available when the PIM concept was originally examined. In order to take advantage of such a new technology to enable memory-capacity-proportional performance, we design a programmable PIM accelerator for large-scale graph processing called Tesseract. Tesseract is composed of (1) a new hardware architecture that fully utilizes the available memory bandwidth, (2) an efficient method of communication between different memory partitions, and (3) a programming interface that reflects and exploits the unique hardware design. It also includes two hardware prefetchers specialized for memory access patterns of graph processing, which operate based on the hints provided by our programming model.

Computation proceeds in discrete synchronous rounds consisting of sending and receiving messages and performing local computations. The running time of an algorithm is the number of rounds it requires. In the static setting the network remains unchanged throughout the entire execution. In the dynamic setting the topology of the network changes, and a new solution has to be computed after each change. In the faulty setting the network is static, but some vertices or edges may lose the computed solution as a result of faults. The goal of an algorithm in this setting is fixing the solution. The problems of (\u0394 + 1)-vertex-coloring and (2\u0394 - 1)-edge-coloring are among the most important and intensively studied problems in distributed computing. Despite a very intensive research in the last 30 years, no deterministic algorithms for these problems with sublinear (in \u0394) time have been known so far. Moreover, for more restricted scenarios and some related problems there are lower bounds of \u03a9(\u0394) [13, 14, 20, 27]. The question of the possibility to devise algorithms that overcome this challenging barrier is one of the most fundamental questions in distributed symmetry breaking [4, 6, 13, 14, 19, 24]. In this paper we settle this question for (\u0394 + 1)-vertex-coloring and (2\u0394 - 1)-edge-coloring by devising deterministic algorithms that require O(\u03943/4 log \u0394 + log* n) time in the static, dynamic and faulty settings. (The term log* n is unavoidable in view of the lower bound of Linial [21]. Moreover, for (1 + o(1))\u0394-vertex-coloring and (2 + o(1))\u0394-edge-coloring we devise algorithms with \u00d5(\u221a\u0394 + log* n) deterministic time. This is roughly a quadratic improvement comparing to the state-of-the-art that requires O(\u0394 + log* n) time [4, 19, 24]. Our results are actually more general than that since they apply also to a variant of the list-coloring problem that generalizes ordinary coloring.\n Our results are obtained using a novel technique for coloring partially-colored graphs (also known as fixing). We partition the uncolored parts into a small number of subgraphs with certain helpful properties. Then we color these subgraphs gradually using a technique that employs constructions of polynomials in a novel way. Our construction is inspired by the algorithm of Linial [21] for ordinary O(\u03942)-coloring. However, it is a more sophisticated construction that differs from [21] in several important respects. These new insights in using systems of polynomials allow us to significantly speed up the O(\u0394)-coloring algorithms. Moreover, they allow us to devise algorithms with the same running time also in the more complicated settings of dynamic and faulty networks.", "year": "2015", "authors": ["Leonid Barenboim"], "refs": []},

While such an instruction can improve performance due to generating fewer TLB and cache accesses, and requiring fewer pipeline resources, in this paper we show that the key to significantly improving the performance is removing pipeline and cache bottlenecks of the code that follows the instructions. We show that the bottlenecks arise due to (1) the pipeline clogged by the copying instruction, (2) lengthened critical path due to dependent instructions stalling while waiting for the copying to complete, and (3) the inability to specify (separately) the cacheability of the source and destination regions. We propose FastBCI, an architecture support that achieves the granularity efficiency of a bulk copying/ initialization instruction, but without its pipeline and cache bottlenecks. When applied to OS kernel buffer management, we show that on average FastBCI achieves anywhere between 23% to 32% speedup ratios, which is roughly 3x-4x of an alternative scheme, and 1.5x-2x of a highly optimistic DMA with zero setup and interrupt overheads.", "year": "2009", "authors": ["Xiaowei Jiang", "Yan Solihin", "Li Zhao", "Ravi R.

In the same paper Linial asked whether one can color with significantly less than \u0394<sup>2</sup> colors in deterministic polylogarithmic time.

The idea is to dynamically group sets of consecutive instructions into chunks that appear to execute atomically and in isolation. The hardware enforces SC at the coarse grain of chunks which, to the program, appears as providing SC at the individual memory access level. BulkSC keeps the implementation simple by largely decoupling memory consistency enforcement from processor structures.

However, it is still challenging to integrate the PIM architectures with existing systems in a seamless manner due to two common characteristics: unconventional programming models for in-memory computation units and lack of ability to utilize large on-chip caches. In this paper, we propose a new PIM architecture that (I) does not change the existing sequential programming models and (2) automatically decides whether to execute PIM operations in memory or processors depending on the locality of data. The key idea is to implement simple in-memory computation using compute-capable memory commands and use specialized instructions, which we call PIM-enabled instructions, to invoke in-memory computation. This allows PIM operations to be interoperable with existing programming models, cache coherence protocols, and virtual memory mechanisms with no modification. In addition, we introduce a simple hardware structure that monitors the locality of data accessed by a PIM-enabled instruction at runtime to adaptively execute the instruction at the host processor (instead of in memory) when the instruction can benefit from large on-chip caches. Consequently, our architecture provides the illusion that PIM operations are executed as if they were host processor instructions. We provide a case study of how ten emerging data-intensive workloads can benefit from our new PIM abstraction and its hardware implementation.

So-called try locks, traditionally based on non-scalable test-and-set locks, allow a process to abandon its attempt to acquire a lock after a given amount of time. The process can then pursue an alternative code path, or yield the processor to some other process.\nWe demonstrate that it is possible to obtain both scalability and bounded waiting, using variants of the queue-based locks of Craig, Landin, and Hagersten, and of Mellor-Crummey and Scott. A process that decides to stop waiting for one of these new locks can ``link itself out of line'' atomically. Single-processor experiments reveal performance penalties of 50--100\\% for the CLH and MCS try locks in comparison to their standard versions; this marginal cost decreases with larger numbers of processors.\nWe have also compared our queue-based locks to a traditional \\tatas\\ lock with exponential backoff and timeout. At modest (non-zero) levels of contention, the queued locks sacrifice cache locality for fairness, resulting in a worst-case 3X performance penalty.

How to build a processor that provides high single-thread performance and enables multiple of these to be placed on the same die for high throughput while dynamically adapting for future applications? Conventional approaches for high single-thread performance rely on large and complex cores to sustain a large instruction window for memory tolerance, making them unsuitable for multi-core chips. We present Continual Flow Pipelines (CFP) as a new non-blocking processor pipeline architecture that achieves the performance of a large instruction window without requiring cycle-critical structures such as the scheduler and register file to be large. We show that to achieve benefits of a large instruction window, inefficiencies in management of both the scheduler and register file must be addressed, and we propose a unified solution. The non-blocking property of CFP keeps key processor structures affecting cycle time and power (scheduler, register file), and die size (second level cache) small.

The communication scalability of synchronization has been improved by the introduction of queue-based spin-locks instead of Test&(Test&Set). For architectures with long access latencies for global data, attention should also be paid to the number of global accesses that are involved in synchronization. We present a method to characterize the performance of proposed queue lock algorithms, and apply it to previously published algorithms. We also present two new queue locks, the LH lock and the M lock. We compare the locks in terms of performance, memory requirements, code size and required hardware support. The LH lock is the simplest of all the locks, yet requires only an atomic swap operation. The M lock is superior in terms of global accesses needed to perform synchronization and still competitive in all other criteria. We conclude that the M lock is the best overall queue lock for the class of architectures studied.<<ETX>>", "year": "1994", "authors": ["Peter S.

CACTI-3DD includes TSV models, improves models for 2D off-chip DRAM main memory over current versions of CACTI, and includes 3D integration models that enable the analysis of a full spectrum of 3D DRAM designs from coarse-grained rank-level 3D stacking to bank-level 3D stacking.

This can be accomplished through mutual exclusion; guaranteeing a process exclusive access while performing critical operations on the data structure. While well understood, this approach can have detrimental effects on performance in an asynchronous environment where processes can suffer unpredictable delays. \nAn alternative approach is to avoid the use of mutual exclusion through the use of simple synchronization primitives such as Compare-and-Swap. Such lock-free data structures can be immune from performance degradation due to slow processes. Universal methods for constructing lock-free data structures for any abstract data type are known, but the resulting implementations are much less efficient than using conventional techniques for mutual exclusion such as spin locks. \nIn this thesis, we present lock-free data structures, algorithms, and memory management techniques for several common abstract data types. Our techniques result in implementations that are as efficient, if not more so, than conventional approaches, and thus provide a practical alternative to using spin locks. We demonstrate the efficiency of our techniques experimentally, and we also show how standard axiomatic formal proof methods can be adapted for the verification of our algorithms.", "year": "1996", "authors": ["John D.

Repeating this process allows us to trace a path, within the particle set itself, from each particle in the direction of increasing density. The path ends when it reaches a particle that is its own densest neighbor; all particles reaching the same such particle are identified as a group. Combined with an adaptive smoothing kernel for finding the densities, this method is spatially adaptive, coordinate-free, and numerically straightforward. One can proceed to process the output by truncating groups at a particular density contour and combining groups that share a (possibly different) density contour. While the resulting algorithm has several user-chosen parameters, we show that the results are insensitive to most of these, the exception being the outer density cutoff of the groups.", "year": "1998", "authors": ["Daniel J.

An implementation is non-blocking if an adversarial scheduler cannot stop the system from making progress. Existing wait-free implementations of shared data structures are slow when contention (processor concurrency) is low, namely, they have an Cl(n) term in their time complexity, where n is the total number of processes, however their time complexity for each operation is bounded. On the other hand, non-blocking implementations are fast when contention is low, but do not provide bounds on the time complexity of indwidual operations when contention is high. Neither seems to be satisfactory in practice. Inspired by Lamport\u2019s fast mutual exclusion algorithm [Lam87], we pose in this paper the question of implementing fast and wait-free data-structures. We then devise universal methods that combine the advantages of both non-blocking and waitfree approaches, i.e., fast when contention is low and guaranteed progress of any individual operation. The time complexity of the algorithms presented here is not a function of n, but a function of k the actual number of processes that access the object concurrently, Two such methods are presented here; The first method, which is called group update, replaces the O(n) term in the time complexity of wait-free implementations by an O(min(n, k log k)) term (or more precisely, O(k log k +s + kf), where s and ~ are the data structure size and single update complexity, respectively).

These applications are important in defining the design and performance decisions of future high performance microprocessors. This paper presents a detailed data-sharing analysis and chip-multiprocessor (CMP) cache study of several multithreaded data-mining bioinformatics workloads. For a CMP with a three-level cache hierarchy, we model the last-level of the cache hierarchy as either multiple private caches or a single cache shared amongst different cores of the CMP. Our experiments show that the bioinformatics workloads exhibit significant data-sharing - 50-95% of the data cache is shared by the different threads of the workload. Furthermore, regardless of the amount of data cache shared, for some workloads, as many as 98% of the accesses to the last-level cache are to shared data cache lines. Additionally, the amount of data-sharing exhibited by the workloads is a function of the total cache size available - the larger the data cache the better the sharing behavior. Thus, partitioning the available last-level cache silicon area into multiple private caches can cause applications to lose their inherent data-sharing behavior. For the workloads in this study, a shared 32 MB last-level cache is able to capture a tremendous amount of data-sharing and outperform a 32 MB private cache configuration by several orders of magnitude. Specifically, with shared last-level caches, the bandwidth demands beyond the last-level cache can be reduced by factors of 3-625 when compared to private last-level caches.", "year": "2006", "authors": ["Aamer Jaleel", "Matthew Mattina", "Bruce Jacob"], "refs": ["https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Adaptive-mechanisms-and-policies-for-managing-cache-Speight-Shafi/74b7f049e23a4bbfc964d878bed981285062821b", "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/BioBench%3A-A-Benchmark-Suite-of-Bioinformatics-Albayraktaroglu-Jaleel/33f5421a0dccedfe7f4e9922b0a9e905b459ab26", "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Optimizing-replication%2C-communication%2C-and-capacity-Chishti-Powell/68e5d22c5c4e4270da8959e8a27b7aeb6820365e", "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Organizing-the-last-line-of-defense-before-hitting-Liu-Sivasubramaniam/13c0508b1544523c18d3934fdbc4d40f33dd433d", "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/PIN%3A-a-binary-instrumentation-tool-for-computer-and-Reddi-Settle/0af7b9623e35555710f3a30177c5b0c61e4e30af", "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Scalability-Comparison-of-Bioinformatics-for-on-AIX-Cheng-Mak/63fadfa862fdb9c3177fe8848a49891f4d871d57", "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Using-Bayesian-networks-to-analyze-expression-data-Friedman-Linial/870c3def7358927968361abed8ca3d9c2839e123", "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ATOM-A-System-for-Building-Customized-Program-Tools-Srivastava-Eustace/07662f0771380a4c07e29c106b44420cada352a0"]},

The process, which is called 'k-means,' appears to give partitions which are reasonably efficient in the sense of within-class variance. That is, if p is the probability mass function for the population, S = {S1, S2, * *, Sk} is a partition of EN, and ui, i = 1, 2, * , k, is the conditional mean of p over the set Si, then W2(S) = ff=ISi f z u42 dp(z) tends to be low for the partitions S generated by the method. We say 'tends to be low,' primarily because of intuitive considerations, corroborated to some extent by mathematical analysis and practical computational experience. Also, the k-means procedure is easily programmed and is computationally economical, so that it is feasible to process very large samples on a digital computer. Possible applications include methods for similarity grouping, nonlinear prediction, approximating multivariate distributions, and nonparametric tests for independence among several variables. In addition to suggesting practical classification methods, the study of k-means has proved to be theoretically interesting. The k-means concept represents a generalization of the ordinary sample mean, and one is naturally led to study the pertinent asymptotic behavior, the object being to establish some sort of law of large numbers for the k-means. This problem is sufficiently interesting, in fact, for us to devote a good portion of this paper to it. The k-means are defined in section 2.1, and the main results which have been obtained on the asymptotic behavior are given there. The rest of section 2 is devoted to the proofs of these results. Section 3 describes several specific possible applications, and reports some preliminary results from computer experiments conducted to explore the possibilities inherent in the k-means idea. The extension to general metric spaces is indicated briefly in section 4.

In this paper, we develop an effective index structure, ADI (for <u>ad</u>jacency <u>i</u>ndex), to support mining various graph patterns over large databases that cannot be held into main memory. The index is simple and efficient to build. Moreover, the new index structure can be easily adopted in various existing graph pattern mining algorithms. As an example, we adapt the well-known gSpan algorithm by using the ADI structure. The experimental results show that the new index structure enables the scalable graph pattern mining over large databases. In one set of the experiments, the new disk-based method can mine graph databases with one million graphs, while the original gSpan algorithm can only handle databases of up to 300 thousand graphs.

As system architects and designers leverage ever-increasing CMOS technology densities, a range of two- and three-dimensional silicon integration technologies are emerging which will likely support next-generation high-volume electronic applications and may serve high-performance computing applications. This paper will discuss a few emerging technologies which offer opportunities for enhanced circuit performance, or reduced power as one example. Silicon-on-silicon integration may include three-dimensional (3-D) integration on-chip or may leverage chip stacking or chip integration on package. Common technology features include silicon through-vias, high-I/O interconnection and silicon-on-silicon either as 3-D integrated circuits, integrated chip stacks or silicon-on-silicon packages with passive function or high-bandwidth wiring. Silicon chips on silicon interposers with integrated function such as decoupling capacitors may provide a better module architecture compared to increased on-chip decoupling or off chip discrete capacitors mounted on package at the chip perimeter or underside of the package. Advanced silicon carrier package technology with fine pitch (50 mum) interconnection is described. This silicon carrier package contains silicon through-vias and offers >16times increase over standard chip I/O, a 20times to 100times increase in wiring density over traditional organic and ceramic packaging, and allows for integrated high-performance passives. Silicon carrier technology supports lithographic scaling and provides a basis for known good die (KGD) wafer testing. It may be considered for use in a number of applications including optoelectronic (OE) transceivers, silicon interposers with integrated decoupling capacitors, and mini-multi-chip modules (MMCMs) which integrate heterogeneous dies forming a single \"virtual chip.\"", "year": "2006", "authors": ["J.U.

Computer architecture is commonly taught using simple piecewise methods of explaining how the hardware performs a given task, rather than characterizing the interaction of software and hardware. Visualization tools allow students to interactively explore basic concepts in computer architecture but are limited in their ability to engage students in research and design concepts. Likewise as the development of simulation models such as caches, branch predictors, and pipelines aid student understanding of architecture components, such models have limitations in the workloads that can be examined because of issues with execution time and environment. Overall, to effectively understand modern architectures, it is simply essential to experiment the characteristics of real application workloads. Likewise, understanding program behavior is necessary to effective programming, comprehension of architecture bottlenecks, and hardware design. Computer architecture education must include experience in analyzing program behavior and workload characteristics using effective tools. To explore workload characteristic analysis in computer architecture design, we propose using PIN, a binary instrumentation tool for computer architecture research and education projects.", "year": "2004", "authors": ["Vijay Janapa Reddi", "Alex Settle", "Daniel A.

These limitations currently render several recent non-blocking algorithms inapplicable in most systems. The results presented here eliminate this problem by providing practical means for implementing any algorithm that is based on these instructions on any multiprocessor that provides either CAS or a form of LL and SC that is sufficiently weak that it is provided by all current hardware implementations of these instructions. This is achieved in two steps. First, we propose a slight modification to the interface for LL, VL, and SC, which will not greatly impact programmers.

While they offer several other advantages, it is expected that the benefits from this technology can potentially be off-set by thermal considerations which impact chip performance and reliability. The work presented in this paper is the first attempt to study the performance benefits of 3D technology under the influence of such thermal constraints. Using a processor-cache-memory system and carefully chosen applications encompassing different memory behaviors, the performance of 3D architecture is compared with a conventional planar (2D) design. It is found that the substantial increase in memory bus frequency and bus width contribute to a significant reduction in execution time with a 3D design. It is also found that increasing the clock frequency translates into larger gains in system performance with 3D designs than for planar 2D designs in memory intensive applications. The thermal profile of the vertically stacked chip is generated taking into account the highly temperature sensitive leakage power dissipation. The maximum allowed operating frequency imposed by temperature constraint is shown to be lower for 3D than for 2D designs.

Recently [4, 6, 7] another paradigm has been proposed, in which syncrhonization is accomplished by linking independent read and write operations separated by an arbitraxy computation. The linking is such that the write operation will succeed only if the shared memory has not been modified since the read. We call this transactional synchronization. It is natural to investigate the relationship between these two types of synchronization. Clearly, using transactional synchronization we can simulate an-y RMW primitive using optimal time and space, but is the converse true? It follows from Herlihy\u2019s well-known results [3] that a sufficiently powerful (i.e., universal) primitive is both necessary and sufficient to implement transactional synchronization. More recently, Anderson and Moir [1] have given a construction implementing transactional synchronization from COMPARE&SWAP that requires only constant time. Can sufficiently powerful RMW primitives implement transactional synchronization using only a constant amount of space? We show that the answer is no. In order to answer this question, we propose a model and the r-eservationicommit problem. A solution to this problem is parameterized by three variables: n, M, and k. Informally, a solution to the (M, k)-RC problem for n processes can be used to implement transactional synchronization for a shared memory of size A4 where a single process can have at most k outstanding transactions. It can be shown that any solution to the (1, 1)-RC problem for n processes requires at least n distinct states; by introducing the technical requirement that the solution be memor-yless [2], we can raise this bound to 2n \u2013 1. Thus, any implement ation of transactional synchronization using RMW primitives must use at least n bits of memory. We discuss extending these results to the cases (&f, 1) and (M, k). Both appear to require strictly more space, although the exact bounds are as yet unknown. We also discuss upper bounds for the problem under", "year": "1996", "authors": ["John D.

We use the asynchronous shar-ed memory model. In this model, processes communicate by applying primitive operations (e.g. Read, Write) to a shared memory.

Intuitively, an implementation of shared memory primitives is disjoint-access-parallel, if processes which execute shared memory operations that access disjoint sets of words, progress concurrently, without interfering with each other (under an assumption described in the paper). Two commonly used primitives, both in theory and in practice, are Compare @Swap ( C\u2019&S) and the pair Load Linked (LL) and Store Conditional (SC). We present an efficient, non-blocking, disjointaccess-parallel implementation of LL and SCn, using Read and CBS. SCn is a generalization of SC, which accesses n memory words. This implementation is constructed in three stages. We first present an implementation of L-L, SC and an additional primitive, called Validate ( VL), using Read and C&S. We then present an implementation of Read and CLYSn, using LL, SC and VL ( C&Sn is a generalization of C&S, which accesses n memory words).

The snapshot problem is to design algorithms for the write and scan operations that meet two challenging requirements: (1) operations appear to be atomic, and (2) operations are wait-freeFor any (m-component, n-process) snapshot algorithm, which runs on hardware that supports only word-sized objects, \u03a9(1) and \u03a9(m) are trivial lower bounds on the time complexity of write(i,v) and scan(), respectively. But, are these bounds tight?For a restricted version of the snapshot problem, known in the literature as the single-writer snapshot problem, Riany, Shavit and Touitou [18] showed that the answer is yes: they designed an algorithm with O(1) and O(m) running times for the write(i,v) and scan() operations, respectively. (The single-writer snapshot problem assumes that (i) the number m of words of the snapshot object is equal to the number n of processes, and (ii) only the ith process may write into the ith snapshot word.This paper shows that the same (optimal) running times of O(1) for write(i,v) and O(m) for scan() are achievable for the general problem, known in the literature as the multiwriter snapshot problem.

However, the worst-case time complexity of every existing n-process universal construction is n(n): that is, in any implementation obtained by instantiating a universal construction, in the worst-case a process performs a(n) computation in order to complete a single operation on the implemented object. In fact, a lower bound of n(n) has been proved for the worst-case local time complexity of any oblivious universal construction [12]. Since universal constructions with sublinear time complexity do not seem possible, it is natural to explore \u201csemiuniversal\u201d constructions that can efficiently implement large classes of objects (as opposed to all objects). We present such a construction in this paper. Our construction implements a large class of objects, that we call closed objects. This class includes several common synchronization objects, such as swup, fetch&add, fetch&multiply, and fetch&@ (where @ is any of the boolean operations and, or, or complement). Our construction achieves worst-case sharedaccess time and local time complexity of O(log2 n). Further, at low contention, the time complexity is even lower. The construction assumes that the underlying shared-memory supports LL and SC operations. To the best of our knowledge, if we consider constructions that can implement a class of objects (as opposed to a specific object), this is the first time that the polynomial barrier has been broken for the worst-case time complexity. Finally, Jayanti proves a R(logn) lower bound on the worst-case shared-access time complexity of any implementation of certain closed objects [13]. Thus, the O(log2n) worst-case shared-access time complexity achieved in this paper is within a logarithmic factor of the optimum. \u2018This work is partially supported by NSF RIA grant CCR9410421.

Our first algorithm does not make any assumptions on the order of edges in the stream. It uses space that is inversely related to the ratio between the number of triangles and the number of triples with at least one edge in the induced subgraph, and constant expected update time per edge. Our second algorithm is designed for incidence streams (all edges incident to the same vertex appear consecutively). It uses space that is inversely related to the ratio between the number of triangles and length 2 paths in the graph and expected update time O(log|V|\u22c5(1+s\u22c5|V|/|E|)), where s is the space requirement of the algorithm. These results significantly improve over previous work [20, 8]. Since the space complexity depends only on the structure of the input graph and not on the number of nodes, our algorithms scale very well with increasing graph size and so they provide a basic tool to analyze the structure of large graphs. They have many applications, for example, in the discovery of Web communities, the computation of clustering and transitivity coefficient, and discovery of frequent patterns in large graphs.We have implemented both algorithms and evaluated their performance on networks from different application domains. The sizes of the considered graphs varied from about 8,000 nodes and 40,000 edges to 135 million nodes and more than 1 billion edges. For both algorithms we run experiments with parameter s=1,000, 10,000, 100,000, 1,000,000 to evaluate running time and approximation guarantee. Both algorithms appear to be time efficient for these sample sizes. The approximation quality of the first algorithm was varying significantly and even for s=1,000,000 we had more than 10% deviation for more than half of the instances. The second algorithm performed much better and even for s=10,000 we had an average deviation of less than 6% (taken over all but the largest instance for which we could not compute the number of triangles exactly).", "year": "2006", "authors": ["Luciana S.

However, the lack of an efficient portable lock-free method for the reclamation of the memory occupied by dynamic nodes removed from such objects is a major obstacle to their wide use in practice. We present hazard pointers, a memory management methodology that allows memory reclamation for arbitrary reuse. It is very efficient, as demonstrated by our experimental results. It is suitable for user-level applications - as well as system programs - without dependence on special kernel or scheduler support. It is wait-free. It requires only single-word reads and writes for memory access in its core operations. It allows reclaimed memory to be returned to the operating system. In addition, it offers a lock-free solution for the ABA problem using only practical single-word instructions. Our experimental results on a multiprocessor system show that the new methodology offers equal and, more often, significantly better performance than other memory management methods, in addition to its qualitative advantages regarding memory reclamation and independence of special hardware support. We also show that lock-free implementations of important object types, using hazard pointers, offer comparable performance to that of efficient lock-based implementations under no contention and no multiprogramming, and outperform them by significant margins under moderate multiprogramming and/or contention, in addition to guaranteeing continuous progress and availability, even in the presence of thread failures and arbitrary delays.", "year": "2004", "authors": ["Maged M.

To address this problem, researchers have developed two principal strategies for a concurrent, atomic update of shared data structures: (1)preemption-safe lockingand (2)nonblocking(lock-free)algorithms. Preemption-safe locking requires kernel support. Nonblocking algorithms generally require a universal atomic primitive such ascompare-and-swaporload-linked/store-conditionaland are widely regarded as inefficient.

Our results indicate that our nonblocking queue consistently outperforms the best known alternatives and that data-structure-specific nonblocking algorithms, which exist for queues, stacks, and counters, can work extremely well. Not only do they outperform preemption-safe lock-based algorithms on multiprogrammed machines, they also outperform ordinary locks on dedicated machines.

Inherent defects at the most basic level cause them to be both fat and weak: their primitive word-at-a-time style of programming inherited from their common ancestor\u2014the von Neumann computer, their close coupling of semantics to state transitions, their division of programming into a world of expressions and a world of statements, their inability to effectively use powerful combining forms for building new programs from existing ones, and their lack of useful mathematical properties for reasoning about programs.\nAn alternative functional style of programming is founded on the use of combining forms for creating programs. Functional programs deal with structured data, are often nonrepetitive and nonrecursive, are hierarchically constructed, do not name their arguments, and do not require the complex machinery of procedure declarations to become generally applicable. Combining forms can use high level programs to build still higher level ones in a style not possible in conventional languages.\nAssociated with the functional style of programming is an algebra of programs whose variables range over programs and whose operations are combining forms. This algebra can be used to transform programs and to solve equations whose \u201cunknowns\u201d are programs in much the same way one transforms equations in high school algebra. These transformations are given by algebraic laws and are carried out in the same language in which programs are written. Combining forms are chosen not only for their programming power but also for the power of their associated algebraic laws. General theorems of the algebra give the detailed behavior and termination conditions for large classes of programs.\n A new class of computing systems uses the functional programming style both in its programming language and in its state transition rules.

All operations (i.e., both reads and writes) are assumed to be totally asynchronous and wait-free. For this problem, only algorithms that require at best quadratic time and space complexity can be derived from the existing literature. (The time complexity of a construction is the number of suboperations of a high-level operation and its space complexity is the number of atomic shared variables it needs) In this paper, we provide a deterministic protocol that has linear (in the number of processes) space complexity, linear time complexity for a read operation, and constant time complexity for a write. Our solution does not make use of time-stamps. Rather, it is the memory location where a write writes that differentiates it from the other writes. Also, introducing randomness in the location where the reader gets the value that it returns, we get a conceptually very simple probabilistic algorithm. This algorithm has an overwhelmingly small, controllable probability of error. Its space complexity, and also the time complexity of a read operation, are sublinear. The time complexity of a write is constant. On the other hand, under the Archimedean time assumption, we get a protocol whose time and space complexity do not depend on the number of writers, but are linear in the number of components only. (The time complexity of a write operation is still constant.). >", "year": "1994", "authors": ["Lefteris M. Kirousis", "Paul G.

NBS is deadlock-free, aids fault-tolerance, eliminates interference between synchronization and the scheduler, and can increase total system throughput. \nThese advantages are becoming even more important with the increased use of parallelism and multiprocessors, and as the cost of a delay increases relative to processor speed. \nThis thesis demonstrates that non-blocking synchronization is practical as the sole co-ordination mechanism in systems by showing that careful design and implementation of operating system software makes implementing efficient non-blocking synchronization far easier, by demonstrating that DCASpDouble-Compare-and-Swapp is the necessary and sufficient primitive for implementing NBS, and by demonstrating that efficient hardware DCAS is practical for RISC processors. \nThis thesis presents non-blocking implementations of common data-structures sufficient to implement an operating system kernel. These out-perform all non-blocking implementations of the same data-structures and are comparable to spin-locks under no contention. They exploit properties of well- designed systems and depend on DCAS . \nI present an O(n) non-blocking implementation of CASn with extensions that support multi-objects, a contention-reduction technique based on DCAS that is fault-tolerant and OS-independent yet performs as well as the best previously published techniques, and two implementations of dynamic, software transactional memory (STM) that support multi-object updates, and have O(w) overhead cost (for w writes in an update) in the absence of preemption. \nFinally, I demonstrate that the proposed OS implementation of DCAS is inefficient, and present a design of an efficient, hardware, DCAS implementation that is specific to the R4000 processor; however, the observations that make implementation practical are generally applicable.

When the memory core supply voltage is reduced to below 1.8 V, the electrical performance significantly degrades in two ways. First, sensing speed slows due to the noticeable threshold voltage of source-floated transistors. Second, the necessity of a relatively high Vpp voltage for the word lines may require a tripler-pumping circuit that significantly increases power. In this 1 Gb synchronous DRAM, the bitline precharge level is Vss (ground). The word line reset level is -0.5 V to prevent cell leakage current while reducing the threshold voltage of pass transistors and thus to eliminate word line boosting.

There is no need for declarations or annotations of any sort. No language construct is added in order to cope with overloading.

Overloading of functions defined over different type constructors is supported, as done with Haskell\u2019s constructor classes. No monomorphism restriction is required in order to solve ambiguity problems.

A single program may have many distinct translations and it is important to show that any two translations are semantically equivalent to ensure that the meaning of the original program is well-defined. This property is commonly known as coherence. This paper deals with an implicitly typed language that includes support for parametric polymorphism and overloading based on a system of qualified types. Typical applications include Haskell type classes, extensible records and subtyping. In the general case, it is possible to find examples for which the coherence property does not hold. Extending the development of a type inference algorithm for this language to include the calculation of translations, we give a simple syntactic condition on the principal type scheme of a term that is sufficient to guarantee coherence for a large class of programs.

It would be highly available in spite of component failures. It would require minimal human administration, and administration would not become more complex as more components were added. Frangipani is a new file system that approximates this ideal, yet was relatively easy to build because of its two-layer structure. The lower layer is Petal (described in an earlier paper), a distributed storage service that provides incrementally scalable, highly available, automatically managed virtual disks. In the upper layer, multiple machines run the same Frangipani file system code on top of a shared Petal virtual disk, using a distributed lock service to ensure coherence. Frangipani is meant to run in a cluster of machines that are under a common administration and can communicate securely. Thus the machines trust one another and the shared virtual disk approach is practical. Of course, a Frangipani file system can be exported to untrusted machines using ordinary network file access protocols. We have implemented Frangipani on a collection of Alphas running DIGITAL Unix 4.0.

P/sup 3/T has been carefully designed to address all of the above performance estimation issues. To achieve high estimation accuracy, P/sup 3/T aggressively exploits compiler analysis and optimization information. Our method is based on modeling loop iteration spaces, array access patterns, and data distributions by intersection and volume operations on n-dimensional polytopes. The most critical architecture-specific factors, such as cache line sizes, number of cache lines available, routing policy, start-up times, message transfer time per byte, and so forth, are modeled to reflect the performance impact of the target machine. P/sup 3/T has been developed in the context of the Vienna Fortran Compilation Systems (VFCS), a state-of-the-art parallelization tool for distributed-memory systems. VFCS translates Fortran programs into explicitly parallel message-passing programs. P/sup 3/T successfully guides the interactive and automatic restructuring of programs under this system. The article describes the underlying compilation and programming model and discusses the most critical design decisions made for P/sup 3/T; in addition, it outlines the implementation of the parallel program parameters. Also described are the VFCS context under which P/sup 3/T is applied and the P/sup 3/T graphical user interface. >", "year": "1995", "authors": ["Thomas Fahringer"], "refs": ["https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Automatic-Performance-Prediction-for-Parallel-on-Fahringer/ce65f74367c1621759cc8b9277b6f9ff9400f720", "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Vienna-Fortran-Compilation-System-Version-1.2-Guide-Benkner-Zima/c17e1e309fda10b3aa5c7c8cf5d56a7a5e4a2475", "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Performance-prediction-of-parallel-processing-the-Gemund/33e380c38a45918c483c5e9c6ae7410f040db391", "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Partitioning-and-Scheduling-Parallel-Programs-for-Sarkar/3aefae88a1c2634c94af91d08be98b946d7a2771", "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Latency-Metric%3A-An-Experimental-Method-for-and-and-Zhang-Yan/0ee3b833058d306bc48e57f22da4ba46cb3e7b8e", "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Queueing-Models-of-Parallel-Applications%3A-The-Jonkers/ad137dfe2cdd3bdca0181748bcb4b4a8ce55c766", "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Techniques-and-Tools-for-Reliability-and-Problems-Trivedi-Haverkort/fcef7c2df53914078de3f5e769adbd8c946acffc", "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Using-the-P%2Fsup-3%2FT-to-guide-the-parallelization-Fahringer/045ae4b01b8cbb9098dbee3bf80c66a49445cd28", "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/A-Petri-Net-Approach-for-Performance-Oriented-Ferscha/5d39a369ba4dc9720b922d6bae00e869426b6105"]},

The goal of Swift is to support high data rates in general purpose distributed systems. Swift uses a high-speed interconnection medium to provide high data rate transfers by using multiple slower storage devices in parallel. It scales well when using multiple storage devices and interconnections, and can use any appropriate storage technology, including high-performance devices such as disk arrays. To address the problem of partial failures, Swift stores data redundantly. Using the UNIX operating system, we have constructed a simplified prototype of the Swift architecture. The prototype provides data rates that are significantly faster than access to the local SCSI disk, limited by the capacity of a single Ethernet segment, or in the case of multiple Ethernet segments by the ability of the client to drive them. We have constructed a simulation model to demonstrate how the Swift architecture can exploit advances in processor, communication and storage technology. We consider the effects of processor speed, interconnection capacity, and multiple storage agents on the utilization of the components and the data rate of the system. We show that the data rates scale well in the number of storage devices, and that by replacing the most highly stressed components by more powerful ones the data rates of the entire system increase significantly.", "year": "1991", "authors": ["Luis-Felipe Cabrera", "Darrell D.

The DEcorum file system has three components: the DEcorum protocol exporter (or file server); the Episode physical file system; and the DEcorum client (or cache manager). Episode is a module that implements the Vnode/VFS interface, using transaction logging to allow fast recovery from crashes. To be exact, it implements a VFS+ interface: extensions to the standard Vnode and VFS interfaces, and two new modules, aggregates and volumes, which give flexibility beyond what is provided by Unix partitions to support administration and operation of networks of thousands of workstations. The DEcorum protocol exporter provides remote access to the Episode physical file system via remote procedure calls (RPC\u2019s). It can export access to other physical file systems, such as the Berkeley fast file system, using extensions of the physical file systems to support the VFS+ interface. The DEcorum client exports a Vnode interface, but obtains its data by making RPC\u2019s to a DEcorum protocol exporter. It caches data from the file server. To synchronize accesses to files, preserving single-system UNIX semantics, it relies on typed tokens obtained with the data: guarantees provided by the server that various operations can be performed remotely. Tokens can be revoked by the file server using separate RPC\u2019s. A locking hierarchy is used to avoid deadlock between clients accessing files and servers revoking tokens on the same files; we explain the hierarchy and informally sketch a proof of its correctness. History and Motivation The DEcorum file system is a component of a larger system, the DEcorum Distributed Computing Environment (DCE). The DEcorum architecture was jointly developed by Hewlett-Packard, IBM, Locus Computing, and Transarc. The DEcorum file system component is a follow-on of AFS (formerly the Andrew file system).1 The DCE is built as a layered architecture from modular components. The file system utilizes a collection of modular components, including Hewlett-Packard\u2019s NCS 2.02 remote procedure call facility, Hewlett-Packard\u2019s PasswdEtc 1 Alfred Z.

While traditional network file systems rely on a central server machine, a serverless system utilizes workstations cooperating as peers to provide all file system services. Any machine in the system can store, cache, or control any block of data. Our approach uses this location independence, in combination with fast local area networks, to provide better performance and scalability than traditional file systems. Furthermore, because any machine in the system can assume the responsibilities of a failed component, our serverless design also provides high availability via redundatn data storage. To demonstrate our approach, we have implemented a prototype serverless network file system called xFS. Preliminary performance measurements suggest that our architecture achieves its goal of scalability. For instance, in a 32-node xFS system with 32 active clients, each client receives nearly as much read or write throughput as it would see if it were the only active client.", "year": "1996", "authors": ["Thomas Anderson", "Mike Dahlin", "Jeanna M.

Calypso is a cluster-optimized, distributed file system for UNIX clusters. As in Sprite and AFS, Calypso servers are stateful and scale well to a large number of clients. The recovery scheme in Calypso is nondisruptive, meaning that open files remain open, client modified data are saved, and in-flight operations are properly handled across server recover. The scheme uses distributed state amount the clients to reconstruct the server state on a backup node if disks are multiported or on the rebooted server node. It guarantees data consistency during recovery and provides congestion control. Measurements show that the state reconstruction can be quite fast: for example, in a 32-node cluster, when an average node contains state for about 420 files, the reconstruction time is about 3.3 seconds. However, the time to update a file system after a failure can be a major factor in the overall recovery time, even when using journaling techniques.", "year": "1996", "authors": ["Murthy V.

Static or average behavior analysis may mask transients that dramatically alter system performance.

However, achieving close to peak performance requires careful attention to a plethora of system details. Not only do hundreds of processors interact on a microsecond time scale, but also the space of possible performance optimizations is large, complex, and highly sensitive to both application behavior and system software. If the event frequency is high and the number of processors is large (in the hundreds), the aggregate data rate can be many megabytes/second. Moreover, for a fixed application problem size, both processor-interaction frequency and performance data volume can grow superlinearly with the number of processors. Finally, the relations of specific performance metrics to application performance can vary widely across applications and parallel architectures. To understand these relations while managing potentially large volumes of dynamic performance data, we have developed a data-immersive virtual environment, called Avatar, which explores performance data and provides real-time adaptive control of application behavior. >", "year": "1995", "authors": ["Daniel A.

Beeson's (intuitionistic) logic of partial terms (LPT) is taken as the basic formal system and some of its metamathematical properties are established (for later application). Three di erent avours of Scott's logic of partial elements (LPE) are considered and it is shown that they are conservative extensions of LPT. This result, we argue, corroborates the choice of LPT as the basic formal system. Variants of LPT are introduced for reasoning about partial terms with a restriction operator (LPT + ), monotonic partial functions (monLPT), -terms ( p-calculus) and Y-terms ( p Y-calculus). The expressive powers of some (in)equational fragments are compared in LPT and its variants. Two equational formal systems are related to some of the logics above: Obtulowicz's p-equational logic is related to LPT + and Plotkin's v-calculus is related to one avour of LPE. The deductive powers of LPT and its variants are compared, using various techniques (among them logical relations). The main conclusion drawn from this comparison is that there are four di erent lambda calculi for partial functions: intuitionistic or classical, partial or monotonic partial functions. An (in)equational presentation of the intuitionistic lambda calculus for (monotonic) partial functions is given as an extension of p-equational logic. We conjecture that there is no equational presentation of the classical p-calculus. Via a special kind of diamond property, the (in)equational formal system is characterized in terms of -reduction for partial functions and some decidability problems are solved. 2 Acknowledgements The help of my supervisor, Gordon Plotkin, has been essential for providing the early motivation and discussion with him has always been extremely useful.

The Spritely NFS experiment, which grafted Sprite\u2019s cache-consistency protocol onto NFS, showed that this could improve NFS performance and consistency, but failed to address the issue of server crash recovery. Several crash recovery mechanisms have been implemented for use with network file systems, but most of these are too complex to fit easily into the NFS design. Spritely NFS now uses a simple recovery protocol that requires almost no client-side support, and guarantees consistent behavior even if the network is partitioned.

IPS's model of parallel programs uses knowledge about the semantics of a program's structure to provide two important features. First, IPS provides a large amount of performance data about the execution of a parallel program, and this information is organized so that access to it is easy and intuitive. Secondly, IPS provides performance analysis techniques that help to guide the programmer automatically to the location of program bottlenecks. The first implementation of IPS was a testbed for the basic design concepts, providing experience with a hierarchical program and measurement model, interactive program analysis, and automatic guidance techniques. It was built on the Charlotte distributed operating system. The second implementation, IPS-2, extends the basic system with new instrumentation techniques, an interactive and graphical user interface, and new automatic guidance analysis techniques. This implementation runs on 4.3BSD UNIX systems, on the VAX, DECstation, Sun 4, and Sequent Symmetry multiprocessor. >", "year": "1990", "authors": ["Barton P. Miller", "Morgan Clark", "Jeffrey K.

In fast crash recovery we assume that critical resources will fail, and we do not attempt to mask the failures with redundant hardware or software. Instead, we design the system to recover so quickly that there is little downtime. This approach is intended for environments that can tolerate occasional failures and cannot afford the cost and overhead of redundant resources. \nIn particular, I focus on fast recovery of distributed state. An example of distributed state is the file caching information maintained by servers in most modern file systems. This information describes the state of file caches on client workstations. After a crash, a server must recover this information in order to guarantee the consistency of the caches. Unfortunately, distributed state recovery can be slow and complex. The techniques I have developed reduce state recovery from several minutes to under six seconds for a Sprite file server (Ouster88) with 40 clients. \nThis thesis evaluates three distributed state recovery techniques based on their speed, complexity, and performance overhead. The fastest technique is transparent recovery, so-called because client workstations do not communicate with the server during recovery. Instead, the server stores its distributed state in a protected area of its own main memory called the recovery box. The interface to the recovery box helps detect and prevent corruption of this state information. \nTo achieve fast overall recovery times, we must also recover other parts of the system quickly. For example, we can eliminate a lengthy file system consistency check by using a log-structured file system that recovers in seconds (Rosenb91). By combining the improvements described in this thesis, a Sprite file server can reboot in under 30 seconds. This is two orders of magnitude faster than most modern file systems recover. \nIn addition to evaluating distributed state recovery techniques, this thesis presents some overall guidelines for designing distributed systems that will recover quickly from crashes.", "year": "1994", "authors": ["Mary Baker"], "refs": []},

Next a call-by-name variant of ISWIM is introduced which is in an analogous correspondence withthe usual \u03bb-calculus. The relation between call-by-value and call-by-name is then studied by giving simulations of each language by the other and interpretations of each calculus in the other.

It begins with the connection between the behaviour of a program and its denotation. It turns out that a program denotes \u22a5 in any of several possible semantics if it does not terminate. From this it follows that if two terms have the same denotation in one of these semantics, they have the same behaviour in all contexts. The converse fails for all the semantics. If, however, the language is extended to allow certain parallel facilities behavioural equivalence does coincide with denotational equivalence in one of the semantics considered, which may therefore be called \u201cfully abstract\u201d. Next a connection is given which actually determines the semantics up to isomorphism from the behaviour alone. Conversely, by allowing further parallel facilities, every r.e. element of the fully abstract semantics becomes definable, thus characterising the programming language, up to interdefinability, from the set of r.e. elements of the domains of the semantics.", "year": "1977", "authors": ["G.D.

As a result, the reliability of the embedded multiple computer systems has become a critical factor in the overall reliability of such real-time systems. As control software becomes more complex and dynamic, reliability has come to depend on the ability of the software to be adapted to meet changing real-time needs and computer hardware capabilities. \nThis dissertation examines the problem of adapting software to achieve two goals: (1) software execution within specified deadlines, and (2) software resiliency with respect to computer hardware failures. \nTo achieve these goals, a Real-Time Software Adaptation System (RESAS) has been designed and implemented. It includes: (1) an Object-Based Programming Model which allows the application programmer to create and manipulate adaptable software, (2) an Entity/Relationship Representation Framework which is used to represent important attributes of the software, the computer hardware and their interactions, and (3) an Adaptation Control System consisting of: (a) a Monitoring Mechanism which observes and reports runtime information, (b) a Data Management System which stores and presents information used by the other RESAS components, (c) an Adaptation Controller which makes decisions on the appropriate choices of software configurations necessary to meet the stated real-time and reliability goals, and (d) an Adaptation Enactment Mechanism which performs the adaptations chosen by the adaptation controller. In this dissertation, the theoretical and practical issues associated with software adaptation are discussed, the design and implementation of the RESAS prototype are described, and the results of several tests are given.", "year": "1987", "authors": ["Thomas E.

Also, many more very large (multi-megabyte) files are in use today than in 1985. The second part of our analysis measured the behavior of Sprite's main-memory file caches. Client-level caches average about 7 Mbytes in size (about one-quarter to one-third of main memory) and filter out about 50% of the traffic between clients and servers. 35% of the remaining server traffic is caused by paging, even on workstations with large memories.

Our position is that performance and availability are the desired features of the typical locally-distributed office/engineering environment, and that very fast server recovery is the most cost-effective way of providing such availability. Mechanisms used for reliability can be inappropriate in systems with the primary goal of performance, and some availability-oriented methods using replicated hardware or processes cost too much for these systems. In contrast, availability via fast recovery need not slow down a system, and our experience in Sprite shows that in some cases the same techniques that provide high performance also provide fast recovery. In our first attempt to reduce file server recovery times to less than 90 seconds, we take advantage of the distributed state already present in our file system, and a high-performance log-structured file system currently under implementation.

Parallel architectures allow fast computers to be constructed from unsophisticated hardware. The usefulness of these machines is severely limited unless they are fitted with I/O subsystems that match their CPU performance. \nMost parallel computers have insufficient I/O performance, or use exotic hardware to force enough I/O bandwidth through a uniprocessor file system. This approach is only useful for small numbers of processors. Even a modestly parallel computer cannot be served by an ordinary file system. Only a parallel file system can scale with the processor hardware to meet the I/O demands of a parallel computer. \nThis dissertation introduces the concept of a parallel interleaved file system. This class of file system incorporates three concepts: parallelism, interleaving, and tools. Parallelism appears as a characteristic of the file system program and in the disk hardware. The parallel file system software and hardware allows the file system to scale with the other components of a multiprocessor computer. Interleaving is the rule the file system uses to distribute data among the processors. Interleaved record distribution is the simplest and in many ways the best algorithm for allocating records to processors. Tools are application code that can enter the file system at a level that exposes the parallel structure of the files. In many cases tools decrease interprocessor communication by moving processing to the data instead of moving the data. \nThe thesis of this dissertation is that a parallel interleaved file system will provide scalable high-performance I/O for a wide range of parallel architectures while supporting a comprehensive set of conventional file system facilities. We have confirmed our performance claims experimentally and theoretically. Our experiments show practically linear speedup to the limits of our hardware for file copy, file sort, and matrix transpose on an array of bits stored in a file. Our analysis predicts the measured results and supports a claim that the file system will easily scale to more than 128 processors with disk drives.", "year": "1990", "authors": ["Peter C.

In traditional operating systems, services (e.g., file, display) are intrinsic pieces of the kernel. Process state is maintained in kernel tables, and the kernel contains explicit cleanup code (e.g., to close files, reclaim memory, and get rid of process images after hardware or software failures). QuickSilver, however, is structured according to the client-server model, and as in many systems of its type, system services are implemented by user-level processes that maintain a substantial amount of client process state. Examples of this state are the open files, screen windows, address space, etc., belonging to a process. Failure resilience in such an environment requires that clients and servers be aware of problems involving each other. Examples of the way one would like the system to behave include having files closed and windows removed from the screen when a client terminates, and having clients see bad return codes (rather than hanging) when a file server crashes. This motivates a number of design goals:Properly written programs (especially servers) should be resilient to external process and machine failures, and should be able to recover all resources associated with failed entities.\nServer processes should contain their own recovery code. The kernel should not make any distinction between system service processes and normal application processes.\n To avoid the proliferation of ad-hoc recovery mechanisms, there should be a uniform system-wide architecture for recovery management.\nA client may invoke several independent servers to perform a set of logically related activitites (a unit of work) that must execute atomically in the presence of failures, that is, either all the related activities should occur or none of them should. The recovery mechanism should support this.\n\nIn QuickSilver, recovery is based on the database notion of atomic transactions, which are made available as a system service to be used by other, higher-level servers. This allows meeting all the above design goals. Software portability is important in the QuickSilver environment, dictating that transaction-based recovery be accessible to conventional programming languages rather than a special-purpose one such as Argus [Liskov84]. To accommodate servers with diverse recovery demands, the low-level primitives of commit coordination and log recovery are exposed directly rather than building recovery on top of a stable-storage mechanism such as in CPR [Attanasio87] or recoverable objects such as those in Camelot [Spector87] or Clouds [Allchin&McKendry83].", "year": "1987", "authors": ["Roger L.

This paper extends an earlier optimizer validation and performance evaluation of R\u2019 to di.rfribu& queries, i.e. single SQL statements having tables at multiple sites. Actual R* message, I/O, and CPU resources consumed and the corresponding costs estimated by the optimizer were written to database tables using new SQL commands, permitting automated control from application programs for collecting, reducing, and comparing test data. A number of tests were rnn over a wide variety of dynamically-created test databases, SQL queries, and system parameters. Both high-speed networks (comparable to a local area network) and medium-speed long-haul networks (for linking geographically dispersed hosts) were evaluated. The tests confirmed the accuracy of R*\u2018s message cost model and the significant contribution of local (CPU and I/O) costs, even for a medium-speed network. Although distributed queries consume more resources overall, the response time for some execution strategies improves disproportionately by exploiting both concurrency and reduced contention for buffers. For distributed joins in which a copy of the inner table must be transferred to the join site, shipping the whole inner table dominated the strategy of fetching only those inner tuples that matched each outer-table value, even though the former strategy may require additional I/O. Bloomjoins (hashed semijoins) consistently performed better than semijoins and the best R* strategies. Few of the distributed optimizer models proposed over the last decade CAPER 83, BERN 81~.

The only known validations, for Distributed INGRES [STON 821 and the Crystal multicomputer [LU 853, have assumed only a high-speed local-area network linking the distributed systems. Also, the Distributed INGRES study focused primarily on reducing response time by exploiting parallelism using table partitioning and broadcast messages. In contrast, R* seeks to minimize total resonrces consumed, has not implemented table partitionings, and does not presume a network broadcast capability. There are many important questions that a thorough validation should answer: . Under what circumstances (regions of the parameter space) does the optimizer choose a suboptimal plan, or, worse, a particularly bad plan? . To which parameters is the actual performance most sensitive? . Are these parameters being modeled accurately by the optimizer? .

IPS is based on two main principles. First, programmers should be supplied with the maximum information about the execu\u00ad tion of their program. This information should be available from all levels of abstraction from the statement level up to the process interaction level. To prevent the programmer from being inundated with irrelevant details, there must be a logical and intuitive organi\u00ad zation to this data. Second, programmers should be supplied with answers, not numbers. The performance tool should be able to guide the programmer to the location of the performance problem, and describe the problem in terms of the source program. IPS uses a hierarchical model as the framework for perfor\u00ad mance measurement. The hierarchical model maps program's behavior to different levels of abstraction, and unifies performance data from the whole program level down to procedure and statement level. IPS allows the programmer to interactively evaluate the per\u00ad formance history of a distributed program. Users are able to maneuver through the hierarchy and analyze the program measure\u00ad ment results at various levels of detail. The regular organization of the hierarchy allows us to easily reason about the program's execu\u00ad tion and provides information to automatically guide the program\u00ad mer to the cause of performance bottlenecks.

Queries are submitted to SDD-1 in a high-level procedural language called Datalanguage. Optimization begins by translating each Datalanguage query into a relational calculus form called an envelope, which is essentially an aggregate-free QUEL query. This paper is primarily concerned with the optimization of envelopes.\nEnvelopes are processed in two phases. The first phase executes relational operations at various sites of the distributed database in order to delimit a subset of the database that contains all data relevant to the envelope. This subset is called a reduction of the database. The second phase transmits the reduction to one designated site, and the query is executed locally at that site.\nThe critical optimization problem is to perform the reduction phase efficiently. Success depends on designing a good repertoire of operators to use during this phase, and an effective algorithm for deciding which of these operators to use in processing a given envelope against a given database. The principal reduction operator that we employ is called a semijoin. In this paper we define the semijoin operator, explain why semijoin is an effective reduction operator, and present an algorithm that constructs a cost-effective program of semijoins, given an envelope and a database.", "year": "1981", "authors": ["Philip A.

These data provide detailed information of file opens a directory accesses. Somewhat coarser information on internal file operations has also been collected. An analysis of the data shows that referenced files in our environment are generally small(under 1000 bytes), usually completely read or written, and have short interopen intervals(a succeeding open to a file usually occurs within 60 seconds of the last open). In addition, while there is extensive sharing of some files, this sharing is restricted to standard system files. We see very little sharing of user files.

The first issue is how a measurement system can provide a complete picture about the execution of a program, and how this information should be organized so that users can easily and intuitively access all the data without being inundated with irrelevant details. The second issue is how a measurement tool can supply more information than just performance statistics, and how such information can guide the programmer in locating performance problems and in providing possible ways to make further improvements. \nOur approach to the first issue involves unifying performance information into a single, regular structure that reflects the organization of the program. We have defined an hierarchical model for the execution of parallel and distributed programs as a framework for the performance measurement. A complete picture of the program's execution can be presented at different levels of detail in the hierarchy. Users are able to maneuver through the hierarchy, concentrating on the spots where the most interesting activities have occurred, and can interactively shift their focus. \nThe approach to the second issue is based upon the development of automatic guidance techniques that can direct users to the location of performance problems in the program. Guidance information from such techniques will not only supply facts about problems in the program, but also provide possible answers to improve its performance. The construction of guidance techniques is facilitated by the regular structure of the program and measurement hierarchy. \nA performance system, called IPS, has been implemented on the Charlotte distributed operating system as a test of our models and design. An automatic guidance technique--critical path analysis for the execution of distributed programs--is integrated in IPS. Measurement tests on IPS show that the critical path information in conjunction with hierarchically organized performance metrics provide a comprehensive picture of program's execution and help users identify the cause of performance bottlenecks.", "year": "1987", "authors": ["Cui-Qing Yang"], "refs": []},

Solutions to these problems have been sought, first, by offloading the database system from the mainframe computer to a single, dedicated backend computer. The backend computer has its own disk storage, is used to perform all of the database operations, and interacts with the mainframe. However. database systems with this software single-backend approach still encounter the performance problems when either the backend usage or database applications increase. The software multiple-backend approach to database management and hardware upgrade is therefore proposed to overcome the performance-gains and capacity-growth problems of either traditional mainframe-based database systems or conventional software single-backend database systems. In this paper we specify the design requirements and issues of the software multi-backend database systems. We show how these requirements and issues affect the design and implementation of a multi-backend database system known as MBDS. Since MBDS is designed specifically for performance gains, capacity growth, and hardware upgrade, we benchmark MBDS in order to verify whether its design and implementation can indeed relate the gains and growth directly to the multiplicity of backends in terms of the response-time reduction and invariance.", "year": "1986", "authors": ["Steven A.

To this end, this paper introduces the notion of second-order algebraic theory and develops its basic theory. A crucial role in the definition is played by the second-order theory of equality $\\M$, representing the most elementary operators and equations present in every second-order language. The category $\\M$ can be described abstractly via the universal property of being the free cartesian category on an exponentiable object. Thereby, in the tradition of categorical algebra, a second-order algebraic theory consists of a cartesian category $\\Mlaw$ and a strict cartesian identity-on-objects functor $\\M \\to \\Mlaw$ that preserves the universal exponentiable object of $\\Mlaw$. Lawvere's functorial semantics for algebraic theories can then be generalised to the second-order setting. To verify the correctness of our theory, two categorical equivalences are established: at the syntactic level, that of second-order equational presentations and second-order algebraic theories; at the semantic level, that of second-order algebras and second-order functorial models.", "year": "2014", "authors": ["Marcelo P.

Development, debugging, and execution of projects can take place remotely under the control of any of several UNIX hosts. Acquiring a partition of machines, resetting each machine, and then loading an application onto each machine is performed by invoking a UNIX-resident program (the \"nuggetmaster\").

The processor tends to operate with a memory of cache speed but with main memory cost-per-bit. This configuration has analogies with other systems employing memory hierarchies, such as \"paging\" or \"virtual memory\" systems. In contrast with these latter, a cache is managed by hardware algorithms, deals with smaller blocks of data (32 bytes, for example, rather than 4096), provides a smaller ratio of memory access times (5:1 rather than 1000: 1), and, because of the last factor, holds the processor idle while blocks of data are being transferred from main memory to cache rather than switching to another task. These are important differences, and may suffice to make the cache-based system cost effective in many situations where paging is not.", "year": "1973", "authors": ["Kenneth R. Kaplan", "Robert O.

By feasible we mean that it is possible to configure a number of (slave) minicomputers each of which is driven by identical database management software and controlled by a (master) minicomputer for concurrent operations on the database spread over the disk storage local to the slave computers. This approach to large databases may be desirable because only off-the-shelf equipment of the same kind is utilized to achieve high performance without requiring specially-built hardware and because identical database management software is replicated on the slave computers. The approach makes the capacity growth and performance improvement easy because duplicate hardware can be added and used with replicable software. In this report, we present a new approach to the solution of database management problems involving database growth and performance enhancement. A system which uses a multiplicity of conventional minicomputers, novel hardware configurations and innovative software design is presented. This extensible system tries to achieve the ideal goal of having the performance (both response time and throughput) be proportional to the multiplicity of minicomputers. Our first effort is to identify the major problems and bottlenecks involved in developing such an ideal system.

We address the data distribution and architectural design issues as well as the algorithms that need to be implemented to provide the basic DBMS functions such as query processing, concurrency control, reliability, and replication control. Glossary Atomicity: The property of transaction processing whereby either all the operations of a transaction are executed or none of them are (all-or-nothing). Client/server architecture: A distributed/parallel DBMS architecture where a set of client machines with limited functionality access a set of servers which manage data. Concurrency control algorithm: Algorithms that synchronize the operations of concurrent transactions that execute on a shared database. Distributed database management system: A database management system that manages a database that is distributed across the nodes of a computer network and makes this distribution transparent to the users. 2 Deadlock: An occurrence where each transaction in a set of transactions circularly waits on locks that are held by other transactions in the set. Durability: The property of transaction processing whereby the effects of successfully completed (i.e., committed) transactions endure subsequent failures. Isolation: The property of transaction execution which states that the effects of one transaction on the database are isolated from other transactions until the first completes its execution. Locking: A method of concurrency control where locks are placed on database units (e.g., pages) on behalf of transactions that attempt to access them. Logging protocol: The protocol which records, in a separate location, the changes that a transaction makes to the database before the change is actually made. One copy equivalence: Replica control policy which asserts that the values of all copies of a logical data item should be identical when the transaction that updates that item terminates. Query optimization: The process by which th\u00e8`best'' execution strategy for a given query is found from among a set of alternatives. Query processing: The process by which a declarative query is translated into low-level data manipulation operations. 3 Quorum-based voting algorithm: A replica control protocol where transactions collect votes to read and write copies of data items. They are permitted to read or write data items if they can collect a quorum of votes. Read-Once/Write-All protocol: The replica control protocol which maps each logical read operation to a read on one of the physical copies and maps a logical write operation to a write on all of the physical copies. \u2026", "year": null, "authors": ["M.

Each processor is an independent computer with its own memory and is connected by communication lines to each of its nearest neighbors. Measurements of the first algorithm's performance on the Arachne distributed operating system are presented. For each algorithm, a theoretical model is developed that predicts speedup with arbitrarily many processors. \nChapter five shows how locally-defined iterative methods give rise to natural multicomputer algorithms. We consider two interconnection topologies, the grid and the tree. Each processor (or terminal processor in the case of a tree multicomputer) engages in serial computation on its region and communicates border values to its neighbors when those values become available. As a focus for our investigation we consider the numerical solution of elliptic partial differential equations. We concentrate on the Dirichlet problem for Laplace's equation on a square region, but our results can be generalized to situations involving arbitrarily shaped domains (of any number of dimensions) and elliptic equations with variable coefficients. Our analysis derives the running time of the grid and the tree algorithms with respect to per-message overhead, per-point communication time, and per-point computation time. The overall result is that the larger the problem, the closer the algorithms approach optimal speedup. We also show how to apply the tree algorithms to non-uniform regions. \nA large-network algorithm solves a problem of size N on a network of N processors. Chapter six presents a general method for transforming large-network algorithms into quotient-network algorithms, which solve problems of size N on networks with fewer processors. This transformation allows algorithms to be designed assuming any number of processing elements. The implementation of such algorithms on a quotient network results in no loss of efficiency, and often a great savings in hardware cost.", "year": "1984", "authors": ["John P.

In addition, the application program may optionally specify how to synthesize values of tree nodes from their children's values and how to disseminate information (such as bounds) either globally or locally in the tree. DIB uses a distributed algorithm, transparent to the application programmer, that divides the problem into subproblems and dynamically allocates them to any number of (potentially nonhomogeneous) machines. This algorithm requires only minimal support from the distributed operating system. DIB can recover from failures of machines even if they are not detected. DIB currently runs on the Crystal multicomputer at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.

Progesterone analogs with \u201cnormal\u201d configuration at the six chiral skeletal carbon atoms give rise to abundant ions corresponding to cleavage of the 1\u20132 and 3\u20134 bonds (ketene elimination), to cleavage of the 6\u20137 and 9\u201310 bonds (ring B cleavage), and to cleavage of the 13\u201317 and 15\u201316 bonds (partial ring D cleavage); these reactions are frequently followed by elimination of alkyl radicals. Alkyl groups at C-6 and C-10 exert a pronounced influence on the formation and fragmentation of the [M-ketene] ions. Reversal of configuration at C-10 increases the importance of ring B cleavage, whereas reversal at C-17 favors the partial cleavage of ring D. The fragmentation of 17-alkylprogesterones differs significantly from the general pattern, with acetyl loss (cleavage of the 17\u201320 bond) and partial ring D cleavage as the predominating reactions.

In this paper we extend the theory of Fujiwara about morphisms to the many-sorted algebras, by defining the concept of polyderivor between many-sorted signatures, which assigns to basic sorts, words and to formal operations, families of derived terms, and under which the standard signature morphisms, the basic mapping-formulas of Fujiwara, and the derivors of Goguen-Thatcher-Wagner are subsumed. Then, by means of the homomorphisms between B\\'enabou algebras, which are the algebraic counterpart of the finitary many-sorted algebraic theories of B\\'enabou, we define the composition of polyderivors from which we get a corresponding category, isomorphic to the category of Kleisli for a monad on the standard category of many-sorted signatures. Next, by defining the notion of transformation between polyderivors, we endow the category of many-sorted signatures and polyderivors with a structure of 2-category. From this we get a derived 2-category of many-sorted specifications in which we prove the equivalence of the many-sorted specifications of Hall and B\\'enabou, and deduce the equivalence of the categories of Hall and B\\'enabou algebras. Besides, by defining corresponding categories of generalized many-sorted terms, we prove that the realization of these terms in the many-sorted algebras is invariant under polyderivors and compatible with the transformations between polyderivors, and from this we get an example, among others, of the new concept of 2-institution, itself an strict generalization of that of institution by Goguen and Burstall.", "year": "2012", "authors": ["Juan Climent Vidal", "Juan Soliveres Tur"], "refs": ["https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/The-Completeness-Theorem-for-Monads-in-Categories-Tur-Vidal/38f5eafab247f2a37f0791338da3b830a1469eaf", "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/General-Logics-Meseguer/1f328146c0175a358de4e07dea8ff7fbcf066505", "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Introducing-Institutions-Goguen-Burstall/bf4aa81c2daac90f3bf12e9bed6e4e990986f18b", "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Completeness-of-many-sorted-equational-logic-Goguen-Meseguer/7309097554fb0a8c4c5590fa6eb9dc1820492363", "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Universal-Algebra-Gratzer/bb13037b0d7ed3e30cdb0177a33cbaf03dc62bf0", "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Initial-algebra-approach-to-the-specification.-and-Goguen-Thatcher/d286159c20c595bfc4b5ab525662d67e00c4857d", "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Structures-alg%C3%A9briques-dans-les-cat%C3%A9gories-B%C3%A9nabou/eda5a34ed169fb2aa99acbc5d642fd9ca0c1aab7", "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/On-mappings-between-algebraic-systems-Fujiwara/e04b7d6d9e15c655f68ca5830e2acc49aea1da29"]},

Examples include first order logic (with and without equality), equational logic, Horn clause logic, second order logic, higher order logic, infinitary logic, dynamic logic, process logic, temporal logic, and modal logic; moreover ~, there is a tendency for each theorem prover to have its own idiosyncratic logical system. Yet it is usual to give many of the same results and applications for each logical system; of course, this is natural in so far as there are basic results in computer science that are independent of the logical system in which they happen to be expressed. But we should not have to do the same things over and over again; instead, we should generalize, and do the essential things once and for all! Also, we should ask what are the relationships among all these different logical systems. This paper shows how some parts of computer science can be done in any suitable logical system, by introducing the notion of an ins t i tu t ion as a precise generalization of the informal notion of a mlogical system, m A first main result shows that if an institution is such that interface declarations expressed in it can be glued together, then theories {which are just sets of sentences) in that institution can also be glued together. A second main result gives conditions under which a theorem prover for one institution can be validly used on theories from another; this uses the notion of an institution morphism. A third main result shows that institutions admiting free models can be extended to institutions whose theories may include, in addition to the original sentences, various kinds of constraints upon interpretations; such constraints are useful for defining abstract data types, and include so-called \u2022 data,\" \"hierarchy, \u2022 and regenerating\" constraints. Further results show how to define insitutions that mix sentences from one institution with constraints from another, and even mix sentences and {various kinds of) constraints from several different institutions. It is noted that general results about institutions apply to such mmultiplex\" institutions, including the result mentioned above about gluing together theories. Finally, this paper discusses some applications of these results to specification languages, showing that much of that subject is in fact independent of the institution used.", "year": "1983", "authors": ["Joseph A.

These generalize the classical concept of (enriched) algebraic theory of Kelly and Power [1993]. We also develop a theory for constructing free algebras for ESs and a theory of equational reasoning for TESs. In Part I, we introduce the general abstract, yet practical, concept of equational system and develop finitary and transfinitary conditions under which we give an explicit construction of free algebras for ESs. This free construction extends the well-known construction of free algebras for \u03c9-cocontinuous endofunctors to an equational setting, capturing the intuition that free algebras consist of freely constructed terms quotiented by given equations and congruence rules. We further show the monadicity and cocom-pleteness of categories of algebras for ESs under the finitary and transfinitary conditions. To illustrate the expressivity of equational systems, we exhibit various examples including two modern applications, the \u03a3-monoids of Fiore et al. [1999] and the \u03c0-algebras of Stark [2005]. In Part II, we introduce the more concrete notion of term equational system, which is obtained by specializing the concept of equational system, but remains more general than that of enriched algebraic theory. We first develop a sound logical deduction system, called Term Equational Logic (TEL), for equational reasoning about algebras of TESs. Then, to pursue a complete logic, we give an internal completeness result, from which together with the explicit construction of free algebras one can typically synthesize sound and complete rewriting-style equational logics. To exemplify this scenario, we give two applications: multi-sorted algebraic theories and nominal equational theories of Clouston and Pitts [2007] and of Gabbay and Mathijssen [2007]. 7 Acknowledgements First and foremost, I am deeply grateful to my Ph.D. supervisor Marcelo Fiore for his patient guidance and support, without which this thesis would \u2026", "year": "2010", "authors": ["Chung-Kil Hur"], "refs": ["https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Nominal-Equational-Logic-Clouston-Pitts/eeacc231c8e0d85c6375f489e3e16914c8798708", "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/A-Formal-Calculus-for-Informal-Equality-with-Gabbay-Mathijssen/a968ef5bde09a4428eab0c7fa19f3562890f3bba", "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Abstract-syntax-and-variable-binding-Fiore-Plotkin/93e9c7d68649dc91b265f9e4afe558ac28c336eb", "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Free-Algebra-Models-for-the-%CF%80-Calculus-Stark/0ba3e04b40e13a81c8ddef19d7c4f20aa8cccba8", "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Adjunctions-whose-counits-are-coequalizers%2C-and-of-Kelly-Power/09b843bbd3fff6c5e6fe34c0622a47d364066c9f"]},

Users would like to take advantage of this idle processing power by running one or more jobs in parallel on underutilized workstations. The use of underutilized workstations as computation servers not only increases the processing power available to users, but also improves the utilization of the hardware base. \nHowever, this use must not compromise a workstation owner's claim to his machine: A user must be able to quickly reclaim his workstation to avoid interference with personal activities, implying removal of \"guest\" programs within a few seconds time. In addition, use of remote machines as computation servers should not require programs to be written with special provisions for executing remotely. That is, remote execution should be preemptable and transparent. On the other hand, rather than simply terminate the guest program it should be possible to migrate it to another available workstation. \nIn this thesis, we study the key design and performance issues that affect preemptable remote execution in a loosely-coupled distributed system. Five major topics are addressed in our work: (1) provision of network-transparent execution environments for programs, (2) structuring migration facilities such that they interfere with the normal operation of the system in a minimal manner, (3) elimination of residual dependencies that occur when a program migrates but has state information left in machine-relative servers on the original machine, (4) provision of global scheduling facilities for finding idle/lightly loaded machines for remote execution and migration of programs, and (5) provision of fair access to global resources among the programs and users of a system. In the process of addressing these topics we delineate when remote execution facilities, with or without migration facilities, are useful and under what conditions they are easy (or difficult) to provide.", "year": "1986", "authors": ["Marvin Theimer"], "refs": []},

The synchronous cells in these networks have unit switching delays separating their receipts of external x and left-neighbor alpha inputs from their corresponding productions of external z and right-neighbor alpha outputs. Three basic types of alpha transient behavior are discussed for such networks. In the first type, all transients extend to no more than a bounded number of cells to the right of each x change; in the second, all transients propagate all the way to the right boundary of the network; and in the third, any transient may or may not propagate to the right boundary of the network depending upon the x sequence to the right of the x change in question. In all three cases, necessary and sufficient conditions are given on the type of alpha logic allowed. These conditions are expressed in terms of corresponding alpha state graph structure.

The user's problems and their solutions are described in a natural language such as English. To utilize the services of a data processor, it is necessary to convert this language description into machine language, to wit, program steps. Recently, attempts have arisen to bridge the gap between these two languages. The method has been to construct languages (called problem oriented languages, or POL) that are (i) rich enough to allow a description of a set of problems and their solutions; (ii) reasonably close to the user's ordinary language of description and solution; and (iii) formal enough to permit a mechanical translation into machine language. COBOL and ALGOL are two examples of POL. The purpose of this investigation is to gain some insight into the syntax of POL, in particular ALGOL [1]. Specifically, the method of defining constituent parts of ALGOL 60 is abstracted, this giving rise to a family of sets of strings; and mathematical facts about the resulting family deduced. Now an ALGoL-like definable language (we hesitate to use the inclusive term \"POL\") may be viewed either as one of these sets (the set of sentences) ; or else, as a finite collection of these sets, one of which is the set of sentences, and the remaining, the constituent parts of the language used to construct the sentences. This is in line with one current view of natural languages [4, 5, 6]. The defining scheme for ALOOL turns out to be equivalent to one of the several schemes described by Chomsky [6] in his attempt to analyze the syntax of natural languages. Of course, POL, as special kinds of languages, should fit into a general theory of language. However, it is reasonable to expect that POL, as artificial languages contrived so as to be capable of being mechanically translated into machine language, should have a syntax simpler than that of the natural languages. The technical results achieved in this paper are as follows. Two families of sets (of strings), the family of definable sets and the family of sequentially definable sets, are described. Definable sets are obtained from a system of simultaneous equations, all the equations being of a certain form. This system, essentially parallel in nature, is an abstraction of the ALGOL method of description. Definable sets turn out to be identical to the type 2 languages (with identity) introduced by Chomsky [6].

Computation essentially explores how machines can be made to carry out intellectual processes. Any intellectual process that can be carried out mechanically can be performed by a general purpose digital computer. There are three established directions of mathematical research that are relevant to the science of computation\u2014namely, numerical analysis, theory of computability, and theory of finite automata. The chapter explores what practical results can be expected from a suitable mathematical theory. Further, the chapter presents several descriptive formalisms with a few examples of their use and theories that enable to prove the equivalence of computations expressed in these formalisms. A few mathematical results about the properties of the formalisms are also presented.", "year": "1962", "authors": ["John R. McCarthy"], "refs": []},

This design exceeds the functionality of Harrison '5 package, creating quotients of multiple mutually recursive types simultaneously, and supporting the equivalence of aggregate types, such as lists and pairs.

It introduces Nominal Logic, a version of first-order many-sorted logic with equality containing primitives for renaming via name-swapping, for freshness of names, and for name-binding. Its axioms express properties of these constructs satisfied by the FM-sets model of syntax involving binding, which was recently introduced by the author and M.J. Gabbay and makes use of the Fraenkel-Mostowski permutation model of set theory. Nominal Logic serves as a vehicle for making two general points. First, name-swapping has much nicer logical properties than more general, non-bijective forms of renaming while at the same time providing a sufficient foundation for a theory of structural induction/recursion for syntax modulo \u03b1-equivalence. Secondly, it is useful for the practice of operational semantics to make explicit the equivariance property of assertions about syntax - namely that their validity is invariant under name-swapping.", "year": "2001", "authors": ["Andrew M.

The mechanization makes it possible to show that one collection of theories is correctly interpreted by another collection of theories under a user-specified interpretation for the uninterpreted types and constants. A theory instance is generated and imported, while the axiom instances are generated as proof obligations to ensure that the interpretation is valid. Interpretations can be used to show that an implementation is a correct refinement of a specification, that an axiomatically defined specification is consistent, or that a axiomatically defined specification captures its intended models. In addition, the theory parameter mechanism has been extended with a notion of theory as parameter so that a theory instance can be given as an actual parameter to an imported theory. Theory interpretations can thus be used to refine an abstract specification or to demonstrate the consistency of an axiomatic theory. In this report we describe the mechanism in detail.

We have developed this framework as part of the FTA project in Nijmegen, in which a constructive proof of the fundamental theorem of algebra has been formalized in Coq.The algebraic hierarchy that is described here is both abstract and structured. Structures like groups and rings are part of it in an abstract way, defining e.g. a ring as a tuple consisting of a group, a binary operation and a constant that together satisfy the properties of a ring. In this way, a ring automatically inherits the group properties of the additive subgroup. The algebraic hierarchy is formalized in Coq by applying a combination of labelled record types and coercions. In the labelled record types of Coq, one can use dependent types: the type of one label may depend on another label.

Also required are many special domain constructs (or functors) in order to create the desired structures. There are several choices of a suitable category of domains, but the basic one which has the simplest properties is the one sometimes called consistently complete algebraic cpo's. This category of domains is studied in this paper from a new, and it is to be hoped, simpler point of view incorporating the approaches of many authors into a unified presentation. Briefly, the domains of elements are represented set theoretically with the aid of structures called information systems. These systems are very familiar from mathematical logic, and their use seems to accord well with intuition.

Type systems are hard to get right, and getting them wrong can lead to inconsistencies. Set theory can serve as the basis for a specification language without types.

Polymorphism, overloading, and subtyping can make a type system more powerful, but at the cost of increased somplexity, and such refinements can never attain the flexibility of having no types at all. Typed formalisms have advantages, too, stemming from the power of mechanical type checking. While types serve little purpose in hand proofs, they do help with mechanized proofs.

The first purpose is approached in the first and third sections. Our cohomology has several properties not enjoyed by the Hochschild theory (an explicit relation for the tensor product, a workable sequence for changes from an algebra to a factor algebra, and an explicit formula for going local); however, unlike the Hochschild theory, we have no dimension shifting techniques. For this reason, we restrict consideration to the first, second, and third cohomology modules. The second purpose is considered in the second section. For B and A commutative algebras, we let M(A) denote HomA(A, A), taken modulo the ideal of multiplications by elements in A. Following the prototype theory which Eilenberg and Mac Lane developed for groups, we associate to each algebra homomorphism from B into M(A), an element in a third cohomology module. The homomorphism is called unobstructed if this element is zero. The unobstructed homomorphisms, together with the elements of a certain second cohomology module, are associated in a one-one fashion with the commutative algebra extensions of A by B. The purpose of the fourth and last section is best expressed by considering a point p on an affine variety V over a perfect field k. Let A be the coordinate ring of V, , be the prime ideal associated with p, and Q be the quotient field of A/p. We prove that p is a simple point if and only if the second cohomology module of A with coefficients in Q is zero. In this manner we give a characterization of regular local rings. We also prove that p will be a complete intersection if and only if the difference between the dimensions of the first and second cohomology modules (both of A with coefficients in Q) is the dimension of V. Our third main result is that V will be nonsingular if and only if A has trivial second cohomology with respect to all finitely generated Amodules.", "year": "1962", "authors": ["David K.

By using the sequent schema language in a theorem prover, one gets an ability to allow users to derive new rules and then use such derived rules as if they were primitive axioms. The conservativity result guarantees the validity of this approach.

Plotkin pointed out the problem of finding a fully abstract model for the sequential programming language PCF [16], which had been originally developed by D. Scott [19]. This question turned out to be one of the most enduring problems of semantics. A very nice description of the different approaches to this subject with many references can be found in [5]. In this rather brief overview, we mainly focus on those articles which are related to the work in this paper. The first fully abstract model for PCF was presented by R. Milner [11]. However, it was purely syntactic and did not provide a semantic description of sequentiality. In 1992, K. Sieber presented a syntax free characterisation of sequentiality for types up to order two and proved a full abstraction result for PCF types up to order three [20]. Two years later, P. O\u2019Hearn and J. Riecke used Sieber\u2019s technique and gave the first domain theoretic description of a fully abstract model for PCF [14] by applying the concept of Kripke relations [6]. A different concept was used by several research groups elaborating fully abstract models for PCF by using game semantics, see [2,4,13]. G. McCusker extended this approach to sum types and recursive types [10]. The domain theoretic approach was refined by J. Riecke and A. Sandholm who modified the O\u2019Hearn/Riecke model and presented a fully abstract model for FPC, an extension of call-by-value PCF with sum types and recursive types [18]. After an introduction to some domain theoretic concepts and notations (Section 2) we construct a cartesian closed category SD of domains to capture the concept of sequentiality (Section 3). This category is cartesian closed, besides, it has smash products making the subcategory SD\u22a5 with strict functions ? This paper is an extended abstract of a major part of my PhD thesis. It contains all important results of a technical report that I wrote during a one year stay at the University of Birmingham, however, most of the proofs and many details are omitted.

Names are created with local scope, they can be compared with each other and passed around through function application, but that is all.The intent behind this language is to examine one aspect of the imperative character of Standard ML: the use of local state by dynamic creation of references. The nu-calculus is equivalent to a certain fragment of ML, omitting side effects, exceptions, datatypes and recursion. Even without all these features, the interaction of name creation with higher-order functions can be complex and subtle; it is particularly difficult to characterise theobservable behaviour of expressions.Categorical monads, in the style of Moggi, are used to build denotational models for the nu-calculus. An intermediate stage is the use of a computational metalanguage, which distinguishes in the type system between values and computations.The general requirements for a categorical model are presented, and two specific examples described in detail. These provide a sound denotational semantics for the nu-calculus, and can be used to reason about observable equivalence in the language. In particular a model using logical relations is fully abstract for first-order expressions.", "year": "1996", "authors": ["Ian Stark"], "refs": ["https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Computational-lambda-calculus-and-monads-Moggi/f67dec0099505e23e9441a9a567fea1d97ff69f6", "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Observable-Properties-of-Higher-Order-Functions-or-Pitts-Stark/164d3216d9b5d6854f88f3c6bd13e1d3113f489a", "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Relational-parametricity-and-local-variables-O'Hearn-Tennent/4f4abef9490292bc4b483300f34d7c8eb9576e9c", "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Notions-of-Computation-and-Monads-Moggi/7f2210ff39ef9669f2a84db611c80c4b28f9fffc", "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Fully-Abstract-Models-of-Typed-lambda-Calculi-Milner/9449d16fbc281f07a6cdb572c1cb8d4e58c0f17f", "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/A-Variable-Typed-Logic-of-Effects-Honsell-Mason/edf15f1ce3d574c0b1438513627e8b2a3fa908e1", "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Kripke-Logical-Relations-and-PCF-O'Hearn-Riecke/62379b1f718ead83238f08c4ea1b17ff67d16293", "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Full-abstraction-for-the-second-order-subset-of-an-Sieber/63b983ccc0106748d3e30cc63f3a874834385d00"]},

Support for the manipulation of such objects is provided in several programming languages (e.g. \u03bbProlog, Elf). Such languages also provide embedded implication, a tool which is widely used for expressing hypothetical judgments in natural deduction. In this paper, we show how a restricted form of second-order syntax and embedded implication can be used together with induction in the Coq Proof Development system. We specify typing rules and evaluation for a simple functional language containing only function abstraction and application, and we fully formalize a proof of type soundness in the system. One difficulty we encountered is that expressing the higher-order syntax of an object-language as an inductive type in Coq generates a class of terms that contains more than just those that directly represent objects in the language. We overcome this difficulty by defining a predicate in Coq that holds only for those terms that correspond to programs. We use this predicate to express and prove the adequacy for our syntax.", "year": "1995", "authors": ["Jo\u00eblle Despeyroux", "Amy P.

C Kleene (1978, in \u201cGeneral Recursion Theory II, Proceedings of the 1977 Oslo Symposium,\u201d North-Holland, Amsterdam) and R. O. Gandy (1993, \u201cDialogues, Blass Games, Sequentiality for Objects of Finite Type,\u201d unpublished manuscript) in one tradition, and to G. Kahn and G. D. Plotkin (1993, Theoret. Comput. Sci.121, 187?278) and G. Berry and P.-L. Curien (1982, Theoret. Comput. Sci.20, 265?321) in another. Our model of computation is based on a kind of game in which each play consists of a dialogue of questions and answers between two players who observe the following principles of civil conversation: 1.Justification. A question is asked only if the dialogue at that point warrants it. An answer is proffered only if a question expecting it has already been asked. 2.Priority. Questions pending in a dialogue are answered on a last-asked-first-answered basis. This is equivalent to Gandy's no-dangling-question-mark condition. We analyze pcf-style computations directly in terms of partial strategies based on the information available to each player when he or she is about to move. Our players are required to play an innocent strategy: they play on the basis of their view which is that part of the history that interests them currently. Views are continually updated as the play unfolds. Hence our games are neither history-sensitive nor history-free. Rather they are view-dependent. These considerations give expression to what seems to us to be the nub of pcf-style higher-type sequentiality in a (dialogue) game-semantical setting.", "year": "2000", "authors": ["Martin Hyland", "C.-H.

Byzantine fault-tolerant architectures are attractive because they tolerate any kind fault, but they are rather expensive: at least 3m+1 processors are required to withstand m arbitrary faults. Two recent developments mitigate some of the costs: algorithms that operate under a hybrid fault model tolerate more faults for a given number of processors than classical Byzantine fault-tolerant algorithms, and asymmetric architectures tolerate a given number of faults with less hardware than conventional architectures. In this paper, we combine these two developments and present an algorithm for achieving interactive consistency (the problem of distributing sensor samples consistently in the presence of faults) under a hybrid fault model on an asymmetric architecture. The extended fault model and asymmetric architecture complicate the arguments for the correctness and the number of faults tolerated by the algorithm. To increase assurance, we have formally verified these properties and checked the proofs mechanically using the PVS verification system. We argue that mechanically supported formal methods allow for effective reuse of intellectual resources, such as specifications and proofs, and that exercises such as this can now be performed very economically.<<ETX>>", "year": "1994", "authors": ["P.

We consider a simple language (equivalent to a fragment of Standard ML) of typed, higher order functions that can dynamically create fresh names; names are created with local scope, can be tested for equality and can be passed around via function application, but that is all. Despite the extreme simplicity of the language and its operational semantics, the observable properties of such functions are shown to be very subtle. A notion of \u2018logical relation\u2019 is introduced which incorporates a version of representation independence for local names. We show how to use it to establish observational equivalences.

By formalizing the original Pease, etal work, Bevier and Young mechanically proved that such a network achieves fault tolerance. In this paper we develop, formalize and discuss a hardware design that has been mechanically proved to implement their processor. In particular, we formally define mapping functions from the abstract state space of the Bevier-Young processor to a concrete state space of a hardware module and state a theorem that expresses the claim that the hardware correctly implements the processor.

This accounting is made possible by removing the \u2018structural\u2019 rules of contraction and weakening, adding a modal operator and adding finer versions of the propositional connectives. Linear logic has fundamental logical interest and applications to computer science, particularly to Petri nets, concurrency, storage allocation, garbage collection and the control structure of logic programs. In addition, there is a direct correspondence between polynomial-time computation and proof normalization in a bounded form of linear logic. In this paper we show that unlike most other propositional (quantifier-free) logics, full propositional linear logic is undecidable. Further, we prove that without the modal storage operator, which indicates unboundedness of resources, the decision problem becomes PSPACE-complete.

Many authors have investigated properties of posets satisfying some sort of chain-completeness condition (see [,11, [-31, [6], I-71, [17], [,181, ['191, [,211, [,221), and used them in a variety of applications. In this paper we study the notion of chain-completeness and demonstrate its usefulness for various applications. Chain-complete posets behave in many respects like complete lattices; in fact, a chaincomplete lattice is a complete lattice. But in many cases it is the existence of sup's of chains, and not the existence of arbitrary sup's, that is crucial. More generally, let P be called chain s-complete when every chain of cardinality not greater than ~ has a sup. We first show that if a poset P is chain s-complete, then every directed subset of P with cardinality not exceeding ct has a sup in P. This sharpens the known result ([,8], [,181) that in any chain-complete poset, every directed set has a sup. Often a property holds for every directed set i f and only if it holds for every chain. We show that direct (inverse) limits exist in a category if and only if 'chain colimits' ('chain limits') exist. Since every chain has a well-ordered cofinal subset [11, p. 681, one need only work with well-ordered collections of objects in a category to establish or disprove the existence of direct and inverse limits. Similarly, a topological space is compact if and only if every 'chain of points' has a cluster point. A 'chain of points' is a generalization of a sequence. Chain-complete posers, like complete lattices, arise from closure operators in a fairly direct manner. Using closure operators we show how to form the chaincompletion P of any poset P. The chain-completion/~ of a poset P is a chain-complete poset with the property that any chain-continuous map from a poser P into a chain-complete poset Q extends uniquely to a chain-continuous map from the completion/~ into Q, where by a chaincontinuous map we mean one that preserves sup's of chains. If P is already chaincomplete, then/~ is naturally isomorphic to P.

This allows for a smooth treatment of discharge and variable occurence conditions and leads to a uniform treatment of rules and proofs whereby rules are viewed as proofs of higher-order judgments and proof checking is reduced to type checking.

The unwinding of proofs, namely, the process of applying lemmata and extracting explicit values for the parameters within a proof, is an obvious candidate for mechanization. It corresponds to the procedures of Cut- elimination and functional interpretation in proof-theory and allows the extraction of the constructive content of a proof, sometimes yielding information useful in mathematics and in computing. Resource-aware logics restrict the number of times an assumption may be used in a proof and are of interest for proof-checking not only in relation to their decidability or computational complexity, but also because they efficiently solve the practical problem of representing the structure of relevance in a derivation. In particular, in Direct Logic only one subformula-occurrence of the input is allowed, and the connections established during a successful proof-verification can be represented on the input without altering it. In addition, the values for the parameters obtained from unwinding are read off directly. In Linear Logic, where classical logic is regarded as the limit of a resource-aware logic, long- standing issues in proof-theory have been successfully attacked. We are particularly interested in the system of proof-nets as a multiple-conclusion Natural Deduction system for Linear Logic.

The discussion is based on two definitions of processes given by E. Best and R. Devillers (1987). Their notions of process correspond to equivalence relations on linear logic proofs. It is noted that the cut reduced proofs form a process under the finer of these definitions. Using a strongly normalizing rewrite system and a weak Church-Rosser theorem, it is shown that each class of the coarser process definition contains exactly one of these finer classes which can therefore be viewed as a canonical or normal process representative.

In functional languages it emerged in SASL [Turn76] and Hope [BursS0], and has also found its way into SML [Miln84]. The pattern mathing described here is that of LML which is a lazy ([Frie76] and [Henri76]) variant of ML. The pattern matching in LML evolved independently of that in SML so they are not (yet) the same, although very similar. The compilation of pattern matching in SML has been addressed in [Card84]. The LML compiler project began as an attempt to produce efficient code for a typed functional language with lazy evaluation. Since we regard pattern matching as an important language feature it should also yield efficient code. Only pattern matching in case expressions is described here, since we regard this as the basic pattern matching facility in the language. All other types of pattern mathing used in LML can be easily translated into case expressions, see [Augu84] for details. The compilation (of pattern matching) proceeds in several steps: \u2022 transform all pattern matching to case expressions. \u2022 transform complex case expressions into expressions that are easy to generate code for. \u2022 generate G-code for the case expressions, and from that machine code for the target machine.", "year": "1985", "authors": ["Lennart Augustsson"], "refs": ["https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/The-g-machine%3A-an-abstract-machine-for-graph-Johnsson/3f57de7ffe636098137fd551f81931c12dc719cc", "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/A-compiler-for-lazy-ML-Augustsson/923c1498f6476bb266792397aeb4092db35476a1", "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Compiling-a-functional-language-Cardelli/b61b7ff49e3d106ab8d31a485567d16f07adce8e", "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Efficient-compilation-of-lazy-evaluation-Johnsson/4567792191b40600d9519473cbab3adb8d0f590c", "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Recursion-Equations-as-a-Programming-Language-Turner/90f75b0643b755eea77127f4fa467b6b4a731337", "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/CONS-Should-Not-Evaluate-its-Arguments-Friedman-Wise/0d7c0d0e30e8786a418c5cb580cff2b64b1dadab"]},

Sometimes the latter has been claimed superior because concurrency is represented in a \u2018true\u2019 way; on the other hand, some authors have claimed that the former is sufficient for all practical purposes. Petri net theory offers a framework in which both kinds of semantics can be defined formally and hence compared with each other. Occurence sequences correspond to interleaved behaviour while the notion of a process is used to capture partial-order semantics. This paper aims at obtaining formal results about the relationship between various classes of processes and occurence sequences in net theory. We shall compare an axiomatic approach to the definition of processes with an inductive approach which relates processes to occurence sequences (and generalisations thereof). We shall show that, in general, axiomatic process semantics is more powerful than inductive semantics using occurence sequences. However, we shall also show that the latter can be generalised, or the former be restricted, to yield various equivalence results. The structure of the relation between sequences and processes will also be explored, exhibiting two meaningful relations, one on the sequences and one on the processes, which correspond to each other bijectively.

Dummett regards the construction of a satisfactory theory of meaning as the most pressing task of contemporary analytical philosophy. He believes that the successful completion of this difficult assignment will lead to a resolution of problems before which philosophy has been stalled, in some instances for centuries. These problems turn on the correctness or incorrectness of a realistic view of one or another realm--the physical world, the mind, the past, mathematical reality, and so forth. Rejection of realism amounts to adoption of a variant semantics, and often of a variant logic, for the statements in a certain sector of our language. Dummett does not assume the correctness of any one logical system but shows how the choice between different logics arises at the level of the theory of meaning and depends upon the choice of one or another general form of meaning-theory. In order to determine the correct shape for a meaning-theory, we must attain a clear conception of what a meaning-theory can be expected to do. Such a conception, says Dummett, will form \"a base camp for an assault on the metaphysical peaks: I have no greater ambition in this book than to set up a base camp.\"", "year": "1991", "authors": ["Michael Dummett"], "refs": []},

Towards this end, a non-extensional form of higher-order logic that is based on Church''s simple theory of types is used to provide a generalisation to the definite clauses of first-order logic. Specifically, a class of formulas that are called higher-order definite sentences is described. These formulas extend definite clauses by replacing first-order terms by the terms of a typed $\\lambda$ -calculus and by providing for quantification over predicate and function variables. It is shown that these formulas, together with the notion of a proof in the higher-order logic, provide an abstract description of computation that is akin to the one in the first-order case. While the construction of a proof in a higher-order logic is often complicated by the task of finding appropriate substitutions for predicate variables, it is shown that the necessary substitutions for predicate variables can be tightly constrained in the context of higher-order definite sentences. This observation enables the description of a complete theorem-proving procedure for these formulas. The procedure constructs proofs essentially by interweaving higher-order unification with backchaining on implication, and constitutes a generalisation, to the higher-order context, of the well-known SLD-resolution procedure for definite clauses. The results of these investigations are used to describe a logic programming language called $\\lambda$ Prolog. This language contains all the features of a language such a Prolog, and, in addition, possesses certain higher-order features. The nature of these additional features is illustrated, and it is shown how the use of the terms of a (typed) $\\lambda$ -calculus as data structures provides a source of richness to the logic programming paradigm.", "year": "1987", "authors": ["Gopalan Nadathur"], "refs": []},

This framework not only subsumes that of logic programming, but satisfies the core properties of logic programs more naturally. From a user's point of view, CLP programs have great expressive power due to the constraints which they naturally manipulate. Intuition in the reasoning about programs is enhanced as a result of working directly in the intended domain of discourse. This contrasts with working in the Herbrand Universe wherein every semantic object has to be explicitly coded into a Herbrand term; this enforces reasoning at a primitive level. Finally, from an implementor's point of view, CLP systems can be efficient because of the exploitation of constraint solving techniques over specific domains.", "year": "1987", "authors": ["Joxan Jaffar", "Jean-Louis Lassez"], "refs": []},

Processes are denoted by labeled event structures. Event structures represent concurrency rather directly, as in net theory [Bra80]. The semantics does not simulate concurrency by non-deterministic interleaving. We first define a category E of event structures [NPW79, NPW81, Win80] appropriate to synchronized communication. The category bears a natural relation to a subcategory of trees though an interleaving functor; so results transfer to trees neatly. Then we introduce the concept of a synchronization algebra (S.A.) on labels by adopting an idea of Milner [Mil80b]. An S.A. specifies how two processes synchronize via labels on their events. From each S.A., L, we derive a category EL of labeled event structures with natural operations for composing labeled event structures. In particular the parallel composition L is derived from the product in E. We obtain semantics for a class of CCS-like languages by varying the S.A.. Synchronization algebras are very general so the class is very broad, handling synchrony and asynchrony in a common framework. As a corollary we get an event structure semantics for CCS. When interleaved our semantics is Milner\u2019s synchronization/communication tree semantics [Mil80a]. However our semantics distinguishes more terms as it reflects concurrency.

In [7] Kleene proposed a three-valued logic for use in recursive function theory. The so-called third truth value was really undefined: truth value not determined. This logic is a useful tool in logic-program specification, and in particular, for describing models. (See [11].) Tarski showed that formal languages, like arithmetic, cannot contain their own truth predicate because one could then construct a paradoxical sentence that effectively asserts its own falsehood. Natural languages do allow the use of \"is true\", so by Tarski's argument a semantics for natural language must leave truth-value gaps: some sentences must fail to have a truth value. In [8] Kripke showed how a model having truth-value gaps, using Kleene's three-valued logic, could be specified. The mechanism he used is a famiUar one in program semantics: consider the least fixed point of a certain monotone operator. But that operator must be defined on a space involving three-valued logic, and for Kripke's application it will not be continuous. We apply techniques similar to Kripke's to logic programs. We associate with each program a monotone operator on a space of three-valued logic interpretations, or better partial interpretations. This space is not a complete lattice, and the operators are not, in general, continuous. But least and other fixed points do exist. These fixed points are shown to provide suitable three-valued program models. They relate closely to the least and greatest fixed points of the operators used in [1].

This paper studies a basis concept directly analogous to the concept of a basis for a vector space. The new basis concept includes that of Egli and Constable as a special case, and one of their theorems is a corollary of our results. This paper also summarizes some previously reported but little known results of wide utility. For example, if every linearly ordered subset (chain) in a poset has a least upper bound (supremum), so does every directed subset. \n \nGiven posets P and Q, it is often useful to construct maps g: P \u2192 Q that are Chain-continuous: supremums of nonempty chains are preserved. Chain-continuity is analogous to topological continuity and is generally much more difficult to verify than isofonicity: the preservation of the order relation. This paper introduces the concept of an extension basis: a subset B of P such that any isotone f: B \u2192 Q has a unique chain-continuous extension g: P \u2192 Q. Two characterizations of the chain-complete posets that have extension bases are obtained. These results are then applied to the problem of constructing an extension basis for the poset [P \u2192 Q] of chain-continuous maps from P to Q, given extension bases for P and Q.

By induction on types Berry shows that the stable ordering is \"hidden\" in the fully abstract model of PCF and that the functions in it are stable with respect to it. As remarked above the fullyabstract model cannot contain all such functions. For first order types (of the form (@, ,... rn; ?$ where ci and 7 are ground types) he shows that the stable order is the image of the syntactic order and that the extensional order is the image of Plotkin's operational preorder 5 on terms. He conjectures that this state of affairs holds at all types in the fully-abstract model. The work of Berry and Curien ([Ber and Cur], [Cur]) on models of algorithms shows the stable ordering will be very important for a semantic construction of the full*y-abstract model. Some obvious approaches do not work however. The stable ordering alone does not support sequential functions; both parts of axioms Q for 5 can fail (see 8.2.10) and even coherence of _$ goes (consider 5 for example 82.5). This is why they have produced models of algorithms which are not extensional but do preserve the concreteness axioms up the types. Crudely put,an algorithm is built up from \"events\" whichThe decisions to output or decisions to test input. Chapter 9. Higher tvpe event structures In this chapter we show how event structures may be used to represent exponentiations and products of domains. In particular we produce a category of stable event structures which represent a Cartesian closed full subcategory of Berry's bidomains. We construct the categoryindependently of Berry's results though, of course, the basic intuitions come from Berry's work. Finally we link up configurations of the event structures with bidomains. In fact this is how it was done based on a few heuristic guidelines which we present in the first section. There are many gaps in our understanding. In particular we introduce a new ordering G .L , a sort of dual to Berry's stable ordering; how is it to be interpreted and is there a natural operational characterisation like the one Berry conjectures for the stable ordering? In the final section we indicate how the techniques might be refined to construct a fullyabstract model of PCF which depends on capturing its sequential evaluation. There are many issues raised and left open by this chapter: in this sense it is an introduction albeit a rather lengthy one. We refer to [Mat] for the basic category theory used. 9.1 Introducing higher type event structures We start with a simple example of a higher type event structure which illustrates what we mean by them and how they are to be used. Let us look at event structures of the form cE,i,%) satisfying the single axiom e _> e1 % e\" => e ,,' e\". % These were introduced in chapter 4 where we showed how such event structures represented coherent prime algebraic domains. We showed that such an event structure determined and was essentially determined by a coherent prime algebraic domain; the left closed consistent subsets of an event structure E ordered by inclusion formed the coherent prime algebraic domain k( ) E and conversely such a domain D determined an event structure E, with events the complete primes, so that L() flV E =D. Suppose (Eii$$'i) for i = 0,l are two such event structures. Can we also represent the function space [%(E& -> i(E,)] of all continuous functions ordered pointwise? After Scott [Sco] we know the step functions form a basis of isolated elements. A little work characterises the complete primes of [ i(EO) -> i(~,)] as precisely those step functions of the form / y.yz x 1 --> [e],L , abbreviated as &wl, where x is an isolated element of L(E*) and e an event of E,. In fact [i(Eo) -> fJE,H is coherent and prime algebraic. Define the event structure EO -> E, to consist of events (x,e) (standing for e[x,y]) ordered bv (x,e) 5 (x',e') iff x' GO x 4 e $e' with conflict relation (x,e)$ (xf,el) iff XT x' ,&. e x, e' where we have simply expressed the ordering and incompatability in the functions space. Then by the representation result of chapter 4 we have 73 EO -> E,) 5 [i(EO) -> %(E,)]; the isomorphism simply expresses a continuous function f as tLe configuration Nx,e) 1 e E f(x)]. We have represented the function space as an event structure. &en more simply, we can represent products of coherent prime algebraic domains. Let (Ei,C,qi) for i = 0,l be two event structures as above. Take E. @ E, to be their disjoint juxtaposition defined by the disjoint union (g) of their sets and relations: Then $,(Eo @ E,) Gi(EJX f&): the isomorphism expresses a pair as the configuratton which is a disjoint union of the pair's ar=guments. Of course we have ignored intuition about what the causality relation 5 on event structures means. In the above constructions it can no longer generally mean mmust occur before in time'*. Accordingly a finiteness restriction on the relation such as an event dominates only finitely many events will not generally hold in representing a function space(,This occurs for the construction E0 -> E, in the innocent circumstances of E. including an infinite conflict-free subset and E, being non-nul_1.) A chief virtue of event structures is supposed to be their operational nature; they have previously prescribed possible behaviours in time. Can event structures like I E. -> E, representing a function space be made to reflect behaviour in time? Gnat finiteness restrictions can be imposed which reflect this? We expect some extra structure is involved in order to distinguish the behaviour of the functional events (in E. -> E, say) from say basic input events. Suppose (Ei,~~,~i) for i = 0,l are event structures representing input and output domains. To reflect this, on both we impose the additional axiom 1 g\u2019bl 1 < CO for events e.", "year": "1980", "authors": ["Glynn Winskel"], "refs": []},

These efforts have already resulted in the language PROLOG. The semantics of predicate logic as a programming language have been formulated with an orientation toward the precedural interpretation of logic in van Emden and Kowalski (1976) and Apt and van Emden (1980). The predicate logic core of PROLOG is a restriction to universally quantified Horn sentences with atomic conclusions, so-called definite clauses, and therefore prevents the user from fully expressing logical negation. In the procedural interpretation of logic, a logic program is regarded as its \"if and only if'' version of which half is explicitly presented. The precise definition of this \"if and only if\" version is given in Clark (1980). The interpretations of a logic program are then restricted to the Herbrand models of the \"if and only if,' version of the program, and the formula F is Herbrand valid in logic program P iff F is valid in all such Herbrand interpretations of P. Although the user does not have negation available the control features of PROLOG do allow the user to have a useful but still limited form of negation: to infer ~A from a proof of the unprovability of A. This is sound, as we shall see, in the procedural interpretation of logic. Our purpose here is to use a connection between the semantics of predicate logic as a programming language and the well-studied theory of inductive definability to given a measure to the incompleteness of the negation as failure rule for proving Herbrand valid negations of formulas, and then to show that the negation as failure rule is very highly incomplete in the sense of the measure.

The new code is mechanically derived from a function definition conceived by the user but proved correct by the system before the new code is added. We present a simple formal method for stating within the theory of the system the correctness of such functions. The method avoids the complexity of embedding the rules of inference of the logic in the logic. Instead, we define a meaning function that maps from objects denoting expressions to the values of those expressions under a given assignment. We demonstrate that if the statement of correctness for a given 'metafunction' is proved, then the code derived from function's definition can be used as a new proof procedure. We explain how we have implemented the technique so that the actual application of a metafunction is as efficient as hand-coded procedures in the implementation language. We prove the correctness of our implementation. We discuss a useful metafunction that our system has proved correct and now uses routinely. We discuss the main obstacle to the introduction of metafunctions: proving them correct by machine. (Author)", "year": "1979", "authors": ["Robert S. Boyer", "J. Strother Moore"], "refs": []},

The main novelties, compared to previous works on extracting algorithms from proofs, are the reading of deductions themselves as programs, and that instead of a constructive reading of 3, we use a Leibnitzian view of objects as sets of properties. The method is based on the observation that object-level components of natural deductions can be ignored computationally.

The views and conclusions contained in this document are those of the author and should not be interpreted as representing the official policies, either expressed or implied, of ONR, DARPA, or the U.S. Government Introduct ion Most techniques for extracting the algorithmic contents of proofs fall into three methods. The interpretational method maps a formula ^ to a formula y that renders the constructive contents of <p. One shows that if <p is provable constructively, then y> is true. This is the method underlying Kleene's realizability interpretations, Godel's \"Dialectica\" interpretation, and Kreisel-Goodman's Theory of Constructions. The proof normalization method is based on the special form taken by normal proofs in semantic directed calculi for constructive theories, such as natural deductions for Intuitionistic (Heyting's) First Order Arithmetic. The key property used is existential instantiation: a normal proof of a formula 3x.<p must have, as premise of its last inference, y>[t/x] for some term r. The proof combinatorics method attempts to interpret a natural deduction proof as comprising an algorithm. The method is motivated by Curry and Howard's \"formula as type\" isomorphism [CF58,How80,Lau70,deB70], and underlies the programming language of Per Martin-L6f [Mar79], the family of PRL systems [Con86], and Coquand and Huet's Calculus of Constructions [CH88, Coq]. Our method is a variant, originating in [Lei83], of the proof combinatorics method. It is based on the observation that object-level components of natural deductions can be ignored computationally, leading to a homomorphism from proofs to typed programs, that extracts the computational contents of deductions. The underlying rationale goes back to Leibnitz: in a general setting where objects have a priori no special property, reasoning and computing are with respect to objects' properties, rather than over the objects themselves. The fact that an object x has property P will be reflected in the combinatorics of (potential) proofs of P{x). For instance, if N is a suitable rendition of the property of being a natural number, then a proof of N(x) will have a structure that reflects the construction of x. This approach is applicable to every formalism in which there are no axioms or rules for objects in general, only for properties. Formalisms of this type include Peano's first order axiomatization of arithmetic (in its original form, with a primitive predicate identifier N), second and higher order logic (in which data types, like the natural numbers, can be defined explicitly), and various variants of fixpoint extensions of first order logic. Our approach differs in important respects from previous works on proofs as programs, such as Martin-Lfif's Type Theory (MLTT). We disregard abstraction over individual objects, whereas object abstraction is at the core of the MLTT style. The constructive contents of proofs rests, for us, in the combinatorics of abstraction and application within proofs, in contrast to MLTT, where the constructive contents lies mainly in a constructive interpretation of existential quantification. Our approach is committed to a \"semantic\" view of typing (types as properties) as opposed to the \"ontological\" view of (most variants of) MLTT, where objects come equipped with their type. Finally, our method is particularly suited for reasoning about functions that are partial with respect to data types. Among the technical offshoots of the method are very simple and transparent proofs of Girard's Theorem, that the provably recursive functions of second order arithmetic are all representable in the second order A-calculus, and Godel's \"Dialectica\" Theorem, that the provably recursive functions of first order arithmetic are all computable using primitive recursion in all . finite types. We outline the use of our contraction homomorphisms for three types of calculi. In \u00a7\u00a71-4 we present the method and some of its ramifications and applications for pure second order logic, which is mapped to Girard-Reynolds's pure second order A-calculus. We start with this instance of the method because the target formalism is a pure A calculus. In \u00a75 we exhibit the method for a variant of Peano's Arithmetic and similar \"generative axiomatizations\" of inductively generated data types. \u00a76 outlines applications to \"inductive axiomatizations\", based on first order inductive definitions. Finally, \u00a77 touches on the contraction of second order proofs with restricted forms of comprehension, to second order typed A-expressions with restrictions on type arguments. Since we deal here with functions provable in second order logic, restricting comprehension leads to computational classes well below the provably recursive functions of first order arithmetic, such as the primitive recursive functions, the elementary, and the super-elementary functions [Lei89, Leia, Lei/3, Lei7]. A number of technical elaborations are factored out into appendices, to avoid distraction from the main development. The main results of \u00a7\u00a71-3 were reported in [Lei83]. They were rediscovered by Krivine and Parigot [Kri86, KP87]. Closely related results are described in [Gir89] (see discussion following Theorem V below). The main results of \u00a7\u00a74,5 are contained in \u00a72 of [Lei84], and were reported in December 1983 at the Workshop on Logic in Computer Science at Brooklyn College of CUNY. Acknowledgements.

But this is not quite right, as we cannot input arbitrary real numbers, in fact, only a nite subset of the rational numbers is admissible. Also, not every integrable real valued function can be given an algorithmic description (take e x 2 , for example) and even if it can, the result will normally not exactly equal the integral. We could switch to the other extreme and say that our program | as any computer program | accepts strings of 0's and 1's and outputs a string of 0's and 1's. But this is not at all helpful, as we want to compare diierent integration routines.

The language is ML(1) [Milner 84] and the compiler was first implemented in 1980 as a personal project when I was a postgraduate student at the University of Edinburgh(2). At the time, I was familiar with programming language semantics but knew very little about compiler technology; interpreters had been my main programming concern. Major influences in the design of this compiler have been [Steele 77] [Steele 78] and the implementation folklore for statically and dynamically scoped dialects of Lisp [Allen 78]. As a result, the internal structure of the compiler is fairly unorthodox, if compared for example with [Aho 78].\n Anyway, a compiler for a language like ML has to be different. ML is interactive, statically scoped, strongly typed, polymorphic, and has first class higher-order functions, type inference and dynamic allocation. These features preclude many well-known implementation styles, particularly the ones used for Lisp (because of static scoping), the Algol family (because of functional values) and C (because of nested scoping and strong typing). The interaction of these features is what gives ML its \u201ccharacter\u201d, and makes compilation challenging.\n The compiler has been recently partially converted to the new ML standard. The major points of interest which are discussed in this paper are: (a) the interactive interpreter-like usage; (b) the polymorphic type inference algorithm; (c) the compilation of pattern matching; (d) the optimization of the representation of user defined data types; (e) the compilation of functional closures, function application and variable access; (f) the intermediate abstract machine and its formal operational semantics; (g) modules and type-safe separate compilation.", "year": "1984", "authors": ["Luca Cardelli"], "refs": []},

For example, they are based on search and unification which are also fundamental to theorem proving. We show how an extended logic programming language can be used to implement theorem provers and other aspects of proof systems for a variety of logics. In this language firstorder terms are replaced with simply-typed \u03bb-terms, and thus unification becomes higher-order unification. Also, implication and universal quantification are allowed in goals. We illustrate that inference rules can be very naturally specified, and that the primitive search operations of this language correspond to those needed for searching for proofs. We argue on several levels that this extended logic programming language provides a very suitable environment for implementing tactic style theorem provers. Such theorem provers provide extensive capabilities for integrating techniques for automated theorem proving into an interactive proof environment. We are also concerned with representing proofs as objects. We illustrate how such objects can be constructed and manipulated in the logic programming setting. Finally, we propose extensions to tactic style theorem provers in working toward the goal of developing an interactive theorem proving environment that provides a user with many tools and techniques for building and manipulating proofs, and that integrates sophisticated capabilities for automated proof discovery. Many of the theorem provers we present have been implemented in the higher-order logic programming language \u03bbProlog.

These lie in the vast middle ground between parametric abstraction and full impredicative abstraction. Stratified polymorphism has an attractive, unproblematic semantics, and has the potential of offering new approaches to type inference, without sacrificing useful expressive power. He shows that the functions representable in the finitely stratified lambda -calculus are precisely the superelementary functions, i.e., E/sub 4/ in A. Grzegorczyk's (Rozprawy Mate. IV, Warsaw, 1953) subrecursive hierarchy. He also defines methods of transfinite stratification and shows that stratification up to omega /sup omega / has a simple finitary representation, making it a potentially useful concept in programming language design. The author proves that the functions represented by stratified polymorphism up to omega /sup omega / are precisely the primitive recursive functions. He points out that these results imply that the equality problem for finitely stratified lambda -calculus is not superelementary, and that the equality problem for the calculus stratified up to omega /sup omega / is not primitive recursive.<<ETX>>", "year": "1989", "authors": ["Daniel Leivant"], "refs": []},

Removing the countability condition, we show that there are exactly two maximal cartesian closed full subcategories inside the category of algebraic cpos with least element. One is the natural extension of the class of profinite domains to the uncountable case, the other is a new class of domains, which are characterized by the property that every principal ideal is a complete lattice. The name L- domain is introduced for cpos with this property. Passing to the general situation where no least element is required anymore, we find a pair of categories in place of each the profinite domains and the algebraic L-domains. Thus there are four maximal cartesian closed categories of algebraic cpos in this case. This complete overview over the possible classes of domains allows to prove general theorems about them. This is illustrated by the result that a cpo has an algebraic function space if and only if its space of strict continuous functions is algebraic.", "year": "1990", "authors": ["Achim Jung"], "refs": []},

Originally, temporal logic was designed in order to analyse and reason about time sequences in general (for example, by Emerson and Halpern. 1985, 1986; Lamport, 1980; Gabbay et al., 1980; Pnueli, 1981). In most of the papers in the area of temporal logic concurrency is represented in terms of an arbitrary nondeterministic interleaving. Because of that the difference between concurrency and non-determinism is lost. This is quite acceptable for many pur-poses, but not always, as shown by Mazurkiewicz et al. (1988). A maior consequence, however, is that one is forced to attach formulas to the global states of a distributed system (program). In general, it is very difficult, if not impossible, to observe such global states; parts of the global state may be changing simultaneously due to independent actions carried out on two separate locations. So, we need a formalism which deals only with local states.

Although this is a more complex operation than first-order unification, its availability as a primitive makes certain kinds of programming tasks easier. We illustrate this aspect in the paper by presenting some programs in a higher-order version of Prolog called $\\lambda$Prolog that manipulate objects, such as formulas and programs, whose representation requires structures containing abstractions or bound variables. Specifically, we show (a) how a simple natural deduction theorem prover may be implemented in $\\lambda$Prolog, and (b) how some simple program transformers for a functional programming language may be written in this language. These programs exploit the availability of $\\lambda$-conversion and higher-order unification in $\\lambda$Prolog to provide elegant solutions to several awkward problems inherent in these tasks.

Such grammars have obvious advantages for computational applications, provided that they can be parsed efficiently. However, many of the proposed extensions engender proliferating semantically equivalent surface syntactic analyses.

This algorithm offers a uniform treatment for \"spurious\" syntactic ambiguities and the \"genuine\" structural ambiguities which any processor must cope with, by exploiting the associativity of functional composition and the procedural neutrality of the combinatory rules of grammar in a bottom-up, left-to-right parser which delivers all semantically distinct analyses via a novel unification-based extension of chart-parsing.", "year": "1987", "authors": ["Remo Pareschi", "Mark Steedman"], "refs": ["https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/An-Introduction-to-Unification-Based-Approaches-to-Shieber/98d23c5596b3a48e9407a58c583ed9b97e8176c5", "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/On-the-order-of-words-Ades-Steedman/046f24b1ba2ee394cdcb8f85d7d98a4740c2adf4", "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Combinatory-Logic%2C-Volume-I-Curry-Feys/902952aa7b3965db4b21b4e451dcdc855276ce87", "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Type-Raising%2C-Functional-Composition%2C-and-Dowty/67b63486140e5efb661fd9bfb7dccb2901fdd490", "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/An-introduction-to-unification-categorial-grammar-Zeevat-Klein/687477edbcd29c39b5743c39b426cdc36fbf06b4", "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Coordination-and-constituency-in-a-combinatory-Steedman/cbf82d15ae7067fe372dc33a915eb7f4ecd3540f", "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/FBF-An-Alternative-to-PATR-as-a-Grammatical-Thompson/aed6f8e71ebb5ce225df48f0c6b8d52bb30efd18", "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Incremental-Interpretation-and-Combinatory-Grammar-Haddock/b45e2c912b5a686bf09b6573b14148022af57e52", "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Typed-unification-for-natural-language-processing-Calder/c583f4a1b2b806f5366312d76097b5785d1f4055"]},

These structures, called expansion trees, can be most easily understood as describing a tautologous substitution instance of a theorem. They also provide a computationally useful representation of classical proofs as first-class values. As values they are compact and can easily be manipulated and transformed. For example, we present an explicit transformations between expansion tree proofs and cut-free sequential proofs. A theorem prover which represents proofs using expansion trees can use this transformation to present its proofs in more human-readable form. Also a very simple computation on expansion trees can transform them into Craig-style linear reasoning and into interpolants when they exist. We have chosen a sublogic of the Simple Theory of Types for our classical logic because it elegantly represents substitutions at all finite types through the use of the typed \u03bb-calculus. Since all the proof-theoretic results we shall study depend heavily on properties of substitutions, using this logic has allowed us to strengthen and extend prior results: we are able to prove a strengthen form of the firstorder interpolation theorem as well as provide a correct description of Skolem functions and the Herbrand Universe.

The traditional approach to representing and reasoning about meaning in a computational setting has been to use knowledge representation systems that are either based on first-order logic or that use mechanisms whose formal justifications are to be provided after the fact. In this paper we shall consider the use of a higher-order logic for this task. We first present a version of definite clauses (positive Horn clauses) that is based on this logic. Predicate and function variables may occur in such clauses and the terms in the language are the typed \u03bb-terms. Such term structures have a richness that may be exploited in representing meanings. We also describe a higher-order logic programming language, called \u03bbProlog, which represents programs as higher-order definite clauses and interprets them using a depth-first interpreter. A virtue of this language is that it is possible to write programs in it that integrate syntactic and semantic analyses into one computational paradigm. This is to be contrasted with the more common practice of using two entirely different computation paradigms, such as DCGs or ATNs for parsing and frames or semantic nets for semantic processing. We illustrate such an integration in this language by considering a simple example, and we claim that its use makes the task of providing formal justifications for the computations specified much more direct.", "year": "1986", "authors": ["Dale Miller", "Gopalan Nadathur"], "refs": ["https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/AUTOMATING-HIGHER-ORDER-LOGIC-Andrews-Miller/f4fb54bdd625b438512659d079f990666c0b0551"]},

The languages acceptable for the method are phrased in a theory of types of order w (all finite types)\u2014including the \u03bb-operator, propositional functors, and quantifiers. The resolution method is, of course, a machine-oriented theorem search procedure based on refutation. In order to make this method suitable for higher order logic, it was necessary to overcome two sorts of difficulties. The first is that the unifying substitution procedure\u2014an essential feature of the classic first-order resolution\u2014must be generalized (it is noted that for the higher order unification the proper notion of substitution will include \u03bb-normalization). A general unification algorithm is produced and proved to be complete for second-order languages. The second difficulty arises because in higher order languages, semantic intent is essentially more \u201cinterwoven\u201d in formulas than in first-order languages. Whereas quantifiers could be eliminated immediately in first-order resolution, their elimination must be deferred in the higher order case. The generalized resolution procedure which the author produces thus incorporates quantifier elimination along with the familiar features of unification and tautological reduction. It is established that the author's generalized resolution procedure is complete with respect to a natural notion of validity based on Henkin's general validity for type theory.

The approach is to design and investigate the properties of various dynamic logics with an emphasis on useful expressive power and adequate proof theory. First, rigorous definitions of the propositional and first-order dynamic logics are given, with an emphasis on the flexibility obtained by leaving unspecified the class of programs which these logics can discuss. A large portion of the result obtained to date in the investigation of dynamic logic is included and put in proper perspective. Then, a proof theory is developed based upon the idea of axiomatizing the first order dynamic logics relative to arithmetical universes. Such axiomatizations are supplied and proved arithmetically complete for the regular (flowcharts) and context-free (recursive programs) cases. The notions of diverging and failing are then introduced, with the aid of which the concept of the total correctness of a nondeterministic program is defined and the concept of a weakest precondition clarified. A detailed investigation of the properties of diverging and failing is then carried out, including the construction of arithmetically complete axiomatizations of both the regular and context-free logics obtained by supply dynamic logic with the ability to discuss diverging directly. If a termination condition, a list of zero or more objects, and a new environment; the termination condition is used to govern control flow. This uniform treatment of expressions and statements allows a simple definition of the run-time exception handling mechanism provided in CLU. The meaning of a procedure generator or iterator generator is a function that takes a list of actual parameters, a list of arguments, and an environment, and produces a result as for statement and expression evaluation. The meaning of parameters is given in terms of textual substitution. A non-parameterized routine is viewed as being a generator with an empty parameter list. The meaning of a cluster is a function that takes a list of actual cluster parameters and an operation name, and produces the meaning of that operation.", "year": "1978", "authors": ["David Harel"], "refs": []},

In their system logically related variables accessed by more than one process are grouped together as resources, and processes are allowed access to a resource only in a critical region for that resource. Proofs of synchronization properties are constructed by devising predicates called resource invariants which describe relationships among the variables of a resource when no process is in a critical region for the resource. In constructing proofs using the system of Owicki and Gries, the programmer is required to supply the resource invariants.We show that convexity plays a key role in the derivation of strong resource invariants. We also develop methods for automatically synthesizing resource invariants. Specifically, we characterize the resource invariants of a concurrent program as least fixpoints of a functional which can be obtained from the text of the program. By using this fixpoint characterization and a widening operator which exploits our observation on the importance of convexity, good approximations may be obtained for the resource invariants of many concurrent programs.", "year": "1979", "authors": ["Edmund M.

This area sprang to life around 1956 when Noam Chomsky gave a mathematical model of a grammar in connection with his study of natural languages. Shortly afterwards, the concept of a grammar was found to be of great importance to the programmer when the syntax of the programming language ALGOL was defined by a context-free grammar. This development led naturally to syntax-directed compiling and the concept of a compiler compiler. Since then a considerable flurry of activity has taken place, the results of which have related formal languages and automata theory to such an extent that it is impossible to treat the areas separately. By now, no serious study of computer science would be complete without a knowledge of the techniques and results from language and automata theory. \n \nThis book presents the theory of formal languages as a coherent theory and makes explicit its relationship to automata. The book begins with an explanation of the notion of a finite description of a language. The fundamental descriptive device--the grammar--is explained, as well as its three major subclasses--regular, context-free, and context-sensitive grammars. The context-free grammars are treated in detail, and such topics as normal forms, derivation trees, and ambiguity are covered. Four types of automata equivalent to the four types of grammars are described. These automata are the finite automaton, the pushdown automaton, the linear bounded automaton, and the Turing machine. The Turing machine is covered in detail, and unsolvability of the halting problem shown. The book concludes with certain advanced topics in language theory--closure properties, computational complexity, deterministic pushdown automata, LR(k) grammars, stack automata, and decidability.", "year": "1969", "authors": ["John E.

The design methodology is based upon the use of abstract data types and the construction and verification of both specifications and implementations for them. The abstract data type is a means of modularization which encapsulates the representation of a data structure and the algorithms which operate directly upon it. The specification technique appeals to various mathematical structures (e.g. sets and sequences) to describe an abstract state for objects of a given type. The correctness of the formal specifications is cast in terms of the proof of certain invariant properties of the abstract state. An axiomatic proof rule is given to formulate the theorems necessary for proving the invariance of predicates across formal specifications. The applicability of the methodology to operating systems is explored. It is found that a hierarchical decomposition is most amenable to verification, and that the implementation language used is a function of that hierarchy. The example of a process dispatcher module of a hypothetical operating system is used to illustrate the process of design, specification, implementation, and verification using the methodology. Various properties are proven of the abstract specifications, including one representation of the concept of fair service. Programs are then written for the specifications and their correctness is verified.", "year": "1977", "authors": ["Lawrence Flon"], "refs": []},

Such expansion trees can be defined with or without the use of skolem functions. These trees store substitution terms and either critical variables or skolem terms used to instantiate quantifiers in the original formula and those resulting from instantiations. An expansion tree is called an expansion tree proof (ET-proof) if it encodes a tautology, and, in the form not using skolem functions, an \"imbedding\" relation among the critical variables be acyclic. The relative completeness result for expansion tree proofs not using skolem functions, i.e. if A is provable in higher-order logic then A has such an expansion tree proof, is based on Andrews' formulation of Takahasti's proof of the cut-elimination theorem for higher-order logic. If the occurrences of skolem functions in instantiation terms are restricted appropriately, the use of skolem functions in place of critical variables is equivalent to the requirement that the imbedding relation is acyclic. This fact not only resolves the open question of what is a sound definition of skolemization in higher-order logic but also provides a direct, syntactic proof of its correctness. Since subtrees of expansion trees are also expansion trees (or their dual) and expansion trees store substitution terms and critical variables explicitly, ET-proofs can be directly converted into sequential and natural deduction proofs. A naive translation will often produce proofs which contain a lot of redunancies and will often use implicational lines in an awkward fashion. An improved translation process is presented. This process will produce only focused proofs in which much of the redunancy has been eliminated and backchaining on implicational lines was automatically selected if it was applicable. The information necessary to construct focused proofs is provided by a certain connection scheme, called a mating,of the boolean atoms within the tautology encoded by an ET-proof.

P also states that the categories N, V, A, and P \"correspond to words that are two-place predicates\" (p. 178), which cannot be right, since one-place verbs like_elapse and three-place verbs like give also appear in V constituents. The language of P's chapters is full of impressionistic turns of phrase; \"we can think of X as I r ' , \"X acts as I r ' , and \"X functions as Y\" occur frequently. Differentiating GB from transformational grammar, P asserts: \"In GB, the logical form (or semantics) of a sentence is considered to be just as important as the surface structure of a sentence (the words that we actually hear)\" (p. 188). This appears to suggest that a crucial difference between GB and transformational grammar lies in a value judgment, namely how \"important\" logical form is held to be. It also manages to confuse logical form (which is syntactic) with semantics, s-structure with PF, and sentences with utterances. Yet these distinctions are highly germane to the material discussed. For example, if surface structure contains \"the words that we actually hear\", it is not clear that there is any coherent interpretation of P's long excursus (pp. 155-159) on that old chestnut of theoretical syntax, the putative blocking of the rule want to --> wanna by wh-movement traces. P relies on a distinction between two kinds of empty string: e \"is an empty category, in the sense that we can't hear it spoken\" (p. 157), but it is not the empty string A introduced by MAK on page 3, because, crucially, A ~ e (p. 158). The perceptive student will ask what the formal distinction is between [NpA] and [Npe], and will find no answer. (Linguistically, there is published evidence that the explanation P seeks to present is not adequate anyway; see Postal and Pullum (1982).)

The first and common one, used for example in Pascal, can be said to derive from standard branches of mathematics. Data are organized as Cartesian products (i.e., record types), disjoint sums (i.e., unions or variant types), and function spaces (i.e., functions and procedures). The second method can be said to derive from biology and taxonomy. Data are organized in a hierarchy of classes and subclasses, and data at any level of the hierarchy inherit all the attributes of data higher up in the hierarchy. The top level of this hierarchy is usually called the class of all objects; every datum is an object and every datum inherits the basic properties of objects, e.g., the ability to tell whether two objects are the same or not. Functions and procedures are considered as local actions of objects, as opposed to global operations acting over objects. These different ways of structuring data have generated distinct classes of programming languages, and induced different programming styles. Programming with taxonomically organized data is often called objectoriented programming, and has been advocated as an effective way of structuring programming environments, data bases, and large systems in general. The notions of inheritance and object-oriented programming first appeared in Simula 67 (Dahl, 1966). In Simula, objects are grouped into classes and classes can be organized into a subclass hierarchy. Objects are similar to records with functions as components, and elements of a class can appear wherever elements of the respective superclasses are expected. Subclasses inherit all the attributes of their superclasses. In Simula, the issues are somewhat complicated by the use of objects as coroutines, so that communication between objects can be implemented as message passing between processes. Smalltalk (Goldberg, 1983) adopts and exploits the idea of inheritance, with some changes. While stressing the message-passing paradigm, a", "year": "1988", "authors": ["Luca Cardelli"], "refs": []},

This simplification of the grammar is made possible by an enrichment of the structure and content of lexical entries, using both inheritance mechanisms and lexical rules to represent the linguistic information in a general and efficient form.

Topics include the internal structure of phrases, unbounded dependency constructions of many varieties, and coordinate conjunction a construction long considered the sticking point for phrase structure approaches to syntax.The book concludes with a well developed proposal for a model theoretic semantic system to go along with GPSP syntax. Throughout, the authors maintain the highest standards of explicitness and rigor in developing and assessing their grammatical system. Their aim is to provide the best possible test of the hypothesis that syntactic description can be accomplished in a single-level system. And more generally, it is their intention to formulate a grammatical framework in which linguistic universals follow directly from the form of the system and therefore require no explicit statement. Their book sets new methodological standards for work in generative grammar while presenting a grammatical system of extraordinary scope.\"", "year": "1985", "authors": ["Gerald Gazdar", "Ewan Klein", "Geoffrey K.

Moreover, it has proved possible to formulate many refinements of resolution which are still complete but are more efficient, at least in many contexts. However, when efficiency is a prime consideration, the restriction to first order logic is unfortunate, since many state\u00adments of mathematics (and other disciplines) can be expressed more simply and naturally in higher order logic than in first order logic. Also, the fact that in higher order logic (as in many-sorted first order logic) there is an explicit syntactic distinc\u00adtion between expressions which denote different types of intuitive objects is of great value where matching is involved, since one is automatically prevented from trying to make certain inappropriate matches.

Roughly speaking, this proof demonstrates that each formula of the calculus is a formal theorem which becomes a true sentence under every one of a certain intended class of interpretations of the formal system. For the functional calculus of second order, in which predicate variables may be bound, a very different kind of result is known: no matter what (recursive) set of axioms are chosen, the system will contain a formula which is valid but not a formal theorem. This follows from results of Godel concerning systems containing a theory of natural numbers, because a finite categorical set of axioms for the positive integers can be formulated within a second order calculus to which a functional constant has been added. By a valid formula of the second order calculus is meant one which expresses a true proposition whenever the individual variables are interpreted as ranging over an (arbitrary) domain of elements while the functional variables of degree n range over all sets of ordered n -tuples of individuals. Under this definition of validity, we must conclude from Godel's results that the calculus is essentially incomplete. It happens, however, that there is a wider class of models which furnish an interpretation for the symbolism of the calculus consistent with the usual axioms and formal rules of inference. Roughly, these models consist of an arbitrary domain of individuals, as before, but now an arbitrary class of sets of ordered n -tuples of individuals as the range for functional variables of degree n . If we redefine the notion of valid formula to mean one which expresses a true proposition with respect to every one of these models, we can then prove that the usual axiom system for the second order calculus is complete: a formula is valid if and only if it is a formal theorem.", "year": "1950", "authors": ["Leon Henkin"], "refs": []},

The main problem of the paper is to develop a 'matching procedure' for pairs of terms, so that every common instance of the two given terms is an instance of some term produced by the matching procedure. This is accomplished by analysing the terms according to the formation rules, matching the outermost parts first, then proceeding inductively inward.

(I will not explain this in detail, as A-conversion is described fully in Church's [2], where the Church-Rosser Theorem is Theorem 7 XXVII; see also Chapter 4 of Curry and Feys' [3].) The first part of the present paper contains an abstract form of this theorem. In the second part the abstract result will be applied to prove the Church-Rosser Theorem for A-reduction, and for any reduction defined as a series of replacements of parts of formulae (satisfying certain conditions); this covers Church's 8-reduction, and Curry's weak reduction in combinatory logic (with or without extra arithmetical combinators, and with or without type-restrictions), but does not cover strong reduction [3, ?6F] or Curry's A 77-reduction [3, ?4D].' At the end of Part II a simple abstract theorem will be proved which extends the Church-Rosser Theorem to include A n-reduction; this seems to be simpler than the extension proof in [3, Chapter 4]. Abstract forms of the Church-Rosser Theorem have already been proved by Newman in [4] and Curry in [1], but Rosser and Schroer pointed out in [5] that they do not cover the original theorem as a special case. In [6], Schroer has proved an abstract result which does cover the original one; however his methods are quite different from those used here, and I do not think his result covers, or is covered by, the result in the present paper. Part of Curry's proof of the Church-Rosser Theorem in [3, Chapter 4] is in an abstract setting, though the assumptions he uses are slightly more restrictive than the ones used here.

The present proof is rather an extension of a different proof of the Hauptsatz for second order logic that I have presented in [1]. The main line of the proof may be indicated by saying that one proves three statements of the following kind for a certain property Y: (1) If A is not provable without the cut-rule, then iA belongs to a set K of formulas that has the property b. (2) Every set K of formulas that has the property S9 is satisfiable; hence A is not valid if not provable without the cut-rule.

In this thesis, we develop a new technique for the verification of parallel programs. The technique is stated in terms of axioms and inference rules, and it is used to prove safety and liveness properties of parallel programs. Safety properties are assertions that must be satisfied by the system state at all times; they are analogous to partial correctness. Liveness properties refer to events that will occur in the future, such as program termination or the eventual receipt of a message. In addition to the formal proof rules, we present several heuristics to aid in the preparation of correctness proofs. \nWe model a parallel program as a set of interacting modules (processes and monitors), and we exploit this modularity in the verification process. First we prove properties of the low-level modules directly from their code. We then combine the specifications of the low-level modules to prove properties of higher-level modules, without again referring to the code. Eventually, we prove properties of the entire program. \nWe discuss the application of this verification technique to two classes of parallel programs: network protocols and resource allocators. Most previous approaches to verifying network protocols have been based upon reachability arguments for finite-state models of the protocols. Only protocols of limited complexity can be verified using the finite-state model, because of the combinatorial explosion of the state space as the complexity of the protocol increases. In contrast, our approach allows us to abstract information from the details of the implementation, so that the proof need not grow unmanageably as the protocol size increases. \nThe discussion of resource allocation centers around Hoare's structured paging system, which is a complex hierarchical program. With this example, we demonstrate that many of the techniques used in program verification can be used for specification as well. \nThe thesis also describes a number of tools that have been useful in proving concurrent programs. Two of the most important are history variables and temporal logic. We employ history variables to record the interaction between the modules that constitute a program. Temporal logic serves as a convenient notation for stating and proving liveness properties.", "year": "1980", "authors": ["Brent Hailpern"], "refs": []},

This has permitted an elegant unifying formulation of previous proof methods. In this paper, we attempt to clarify the logical foundations of the application of temporal logic to concurrent programs. In doing so, we will also clarify the relation between concurrency and nondeterminism, and identify some problems for further research.In this paper, we consider logics containing the temporal operators \"henceforth\" (or \"always\") and \"eventually\" (or \"sometime\"). We define the semantics of such a temporal logic in terms of an underlying model that abstracts the fundamental concepts common to almost all the models of computation which have been used. We are concerned mainly with the semantics of temporal logic, and will not discuss in any detail the actual rules for deducing theorems.We will describe two different temporal logics for reasoning about a computational model. The same formulas appear in both logics, but they are interpreted differently. The two interpretations correspond to two different ways of viewing time: as a continually branching set of possibilities, or as a single linear sequence of actual events. The temporal concepts of \"sometime\" and \"not never\" (\"not always not\") are equivalent in the theory of linear time, but not in the theory of branching time -- hence, our title. We will argue that the logic of linear time is better for reasoning about concurrent programs, and the logic of branching time is better for reasoning about nondeterministic programs.The logic of linear time was used by Pnueli in [15], while the logic of branching time seems to be the one used by most computer scientists for reasoning about temporal concepts. We have found this to cause some confusion among our colleagues, so one of our goals has been to clarify the formal foundations of Pnueli's work.The following section gives an intuitive discussion of temporal logic, and Section 3 formally defines the semantics of the two temporal logics. In Section 4, we prove that the two temporal logics are not equivalent, and discuss their differences. Section 5 discusses the problems of validity and completeness for the temporal logics. In Section 6, we show that there are some important properties of the computational model that cannot be expressed with the temporal operators \"henceforth\" and \"eventually\", and define more general operators.", "year": "1980", "authors": ["Leslie Lamport"], "refs": ["https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Consistent-and-complete-proof-rules-for-the-total-Flon-Suzuki/623605bd5e083c9abf45d3a497d54fd02144a31e"]},

In this book, Mulmuley has been able to construct a counterexample through diagonalization; moreover, he has discovered a technique to prove semantic equivalences that has the advantage of being mechanizable. This system, called Inclusive Predicate Logic (IPL), can almost automatically prove the existence of most of the inclusive predicates which arise in practice.Mulmuley also demonstrates that one can construct a fully abstract algebraic model of typed lambda calculus which is a submodel of the classical model, if the classical model is based on complete lattices. Beyond this, the book shows that theory can extend to the case of a language that has reflexive (recursively defined) types-as do most of the \"real\" programming languages.Contents: Introduction to Domain Theory.

However it is also natural to look at the consequences of introducing type-restrictions, formulated by assigning types to the obs according to certain rules, to be described later. Each type is a linguistic expression representing a set of functions, and for any type a the statement \" X has type a\" is intended to mean that the ob X represents a member of the set represented by a. Given types a and /, the set of all functions from the set a into the set 8 is represented by the type \" Fa/3\" (using Curry's notation). Now consider the ob l; if X has type a, then the ob I X must also have type a. Hence I represents a function from a into a, and so it must be given the type Faa, for each type a. Thus I has not just one type, but a whole class of types. This might seem strange, but it comes from the fact that I represents the abstract notion of \" identity-function\", rather than one particular identity-function for a particular set. The identity-function involves basically the same concept, no matter what we are applying it to. Similarly the other two basic combinators S and K (see later, or [1, ?5A]) represent certain simple operations which can be performed on almost any functions, and thus they too have an infinite class of types (see ?1 later for details, and ?5 for comment). To denote classes of types, we can use variables a, b, c; then the fact that I has every type of form Faa can be expressed by assigning to I the type-scheme", "year": "1969", "authors": ["R.

Among the benefits to be derived by constructive mathematics from its association with computer programming, one is that you see immediately why you cannot rely upon the law of excluded middle: its uninhibited use would lead to programs that one did not know how to execute. By choosing to program in a formal language for constructive mathematics, like the theory of types, one gets access to the conceptual apparatus of pure mathematics, neglecting those parts that depend critically on the law of excluded middle, whereas even the best high level programming languages so far designed are wholly inadequate as mathematical languages. The virtue of a machine code is that a program written in it can be directly read and executed by the machine. The distinction between low and high level programming languages is of course relative to the available hardware. It may well be possible to turn what is now regarded as a high level programming language into machine code by the invention of new hardware.", "year": "1985", "authors": ["Per Martin-Lof"], "refs": []},

Traditionally it has been argued that processing natural language syntax requires very powerful machinery. Many engineers have come to this rather grim conclusion; almost all working parsers are actually Turing Machines (TM). For example, Woods specifically designed his Augmented Transition Networks (ATN''s) to be Turing Equivalent. If the problem is really as hard as it appears, then the only solution is to grin and bear it. Our own position is that parsing acceptable sentences is simpler because there are constraints on human performance that drastically reduce the computational requirements (time and space bounds). Although ideal linguistic competence is very complex, this observation may not apply directly to a real processing problem such as parsing. By including performance factors, it is possible to simplify the computation. We will propose two performance limitations, bounded memory and deterministic control, which have been incorporated in a new parser YAP.", "year": "1982", "authors": ["Kenneth Ward Church"], "refs": []},

In this paper we propose some methods for dealing with syntactic ambiguity in ways that exploit certain regularities among alternative parse trees. These regularities will be expressed as linear combinations of ATN networks, and also as sums and products of formal power series.

Its purpose is to illustrate the relationship between the representation chosen for a design problem and the methods developed for solving that problem. A formal class of 'floor plan'-type design problems is defined. In these problems a set of rectangular rooms is specified, and an allowable list of dimensions is given for each room. In addition, a set of required adjacencies between rooms, or between a room and an outside wall of the building, is given. The problem is to produce a rectangular floor plan of a building that contains all of the specified rooms, and that satisfied all of the adjacency and dimension requirements. A linear graph representation for floor plans is developed. This graph is the dual graph of the floor plan, itself treated as a linear graph. Thus, the nodes of the dual graph correspond to rooms, and the edges correspond to adjacencies between rooms. The design methods are implemented in a computer program, GRAMPA, written in IPL-V. Several illustrative problems solved by GRAMPA are discussed. (Author)", "year": "1970", "authors": ["John Grason"], "refs": []},

This paper explores the qualitative nature of this extension to logic programming. For example, if the formula D is the conjunction of universally quantified clauses, we interpret the goal D ae G as a request to load the code in D prior to attempting G and then unload that code after G succeeds or fails. This extended use of implication provides a logical explanation of parametric modules, some uses of Prolog's assert predicate, and aspects of abstract datatypes. Both a model theory and proof theory are presented for this logical language. In particular, we show how to build a Kripke-like model for programs by a fixed point construction and show that the operational meaning of implication mentioned above is sound and complete for intuitionistic logic.

However, a great deal of natural language text, e.g., memos, rough drafts, conversation transcripts, etc., have features that differ significantly from \"neat\" texts, posing special problems for readers, such as misspelled words, missing words, poor syntactic construction, missing periods, etc. Our solution to these problems is to make use of expectations , based both on knowledge of surface English and on world knowledge of the situation being described. These syntactic and semantic expectations can be used to figure out unknown words from context, constrain the possible word-senses of words with multiple meanings (ambiguity), fill in missing words (ellipsis), and resolve referents (anaphora).

The paper focuses on describing a program which realizes the third step of this plan. Step One separates the given representation into groups and generates from each group a set of kernel sentences. Step Two must decide, based upon both syntactic and thematic consideration, the set of transformations that shoulld be performed upon each set of kernels. The output of the first two steps provides the 'TASK' for Step Three. Each element of the TASK corresponds to the generation of one English sentence, and in turn may be defined as a triple consisting of: a list of kernel phrase markers; a list of transformations to be performed upon the list of kernals; a 'syntactic separator' to separate or connect generated sentences. Step Three takes as input the results of Step One and Step Two. The program which implements Step Three 'reads' the TASK, executes the transformations indicated there, combines the altered kernels of each set into a sentence, performs a pronominalization process, and finally produces the appropriate English word string.

As people read stories describing various situations they are able to recall similar episodes form memory and use them as a basis to form generalizations about the way such situations normally occur. This thesis describes an integrated system for language understanding IPP (Integrated Partial Parser), that encompasses the ability to generalize and record information in long-term memory as well as conceptual analysis. IPP is a program that learns about the world by reading stories taken from newspapers and th UPI news wire, adding information from these stories to memory, and making generalizations that describe specific situations. It uses the generalizations that it has made to help in understanding future stories. As it reads stories, IPP adds them to its permanent memory. If it locates similar stories in memory as it does this, then it attempts to make generalizations that describe the similarities among the events. Such generalizations form the basis for organizing events in memory and understanding later stories. IPP also includes a procedure for confirming generalizations as further stories are read. In order to analyze the text that it reads, IPP makes extensive use of top-down, predictive processing. As it processes a story, IPP accesses memory in an attempt to identify generalizations describing stereotypical situations that can provide predictions to be used in understanding. Such use of memory to provide top-down context results in a robust and efficient understanding system. (Author)", "year": "1980", "authors": ["Michael Lebowitz"], "refs": []},

The system answers questions, executes commands, and accepts information in an interactive English dialog. It is based on the belief that in modeling language understanding, we must deal in an integrated way with all of the aspects of language\u2014syntax, semantics, and inference. The system contains a parser, a recognition grammar of English, programs for semantic analysis, and a general problem solving system. We assume that a computer cannot deal reasonably with language unless it can understand the subject it is discussing. Therefore, the program is given a detailed model of a particular domain. In addition, the system has a simple model of its own mentality. It can remember and discuss its plans and actions as well as carrying them out.

This approach, which we call the intermittent-assertion method, involves documenting the program with assertions that must be true at some time when control is passing through the corresponding point, but that need not be true every time. The method, introduced by Knuth and further developed by Burstall, promises to provide a valuable complement to the more conventional methods.\n We first introduce and illustrate the technique with a number of examples. We then show that a correctness proof using the invariant assertion method can always be expressed using intermittent assertions instead, but argue that the reverse is not always the case. The method can also be used just to prove termination, and any proof of termination using the conventional well-founded sets approach can be rephrased as a proof using intermittent assertions. Finally, we show how the method can be applied to prove the validity of program transformations and the correctness of continuously operating programs.\n This research was supported in part by the Advanced Research Projects Agency of the Department of Defense under Contract DAHC15-73-C-0435, by the National Science Foundation under Grant GJ-36146, by the Office of Naval Research under Contract N00014-75-C-0816, and by a grant from the United States-Israel Binational Science Foundation (BSF), Jerusalem, Israel.", "year": "1976", "authors": ["Zohar Manna", "Richard J.

In this paper we will show that this analysis can be improved somewhat within the framework of traditional transformational rules. However, not all difficulties can be eliminated in this way. In an effort to further improve the solution, we will show that, on independent grounds, constraints imposed by the hearer's perceptual strategy for interpreting sentences play a part in the unacceptability of certain con structions. These constraints will then be used to account for the remaining anomalies in the dative shift paradigms. 1. THE SYNTAX OF INDIRECT OBJECTS Let us first try to arrive at the most general transformational solution for the indirect object shifts. For the purposes of exposition, we will assume that the underlying order of objects is direct-indirect, and that the dative movement rules permute the objects and delete the preposition of the indirect object. The alternative, that the opposite order holds in deep structure, and the preposition is inserted, or not deleted, just in case the permutation of objects takes place, is also essentially compatible with the arguments to be presented here. However, we will give some evidence that to and for are present in the deep structure and sometimes deleted (not inserted) by the dative movement transformations.", "year": "1971", "authors": ["Ray Jackendoff", "Peter W.

An automatic program synthesis system must combine reasoning and programming ability with a good deal of knowledge about the subject matter of the program. This ability and knowledge must be manifested both procedurally (by programs) and structurally (by choice of representation). We describe some of the reasoning and programming capabilities of a projected synthesis system. Special attention is paid to the introduction of conditional tests, loops, and instructions with side effects in the program being constructed. The ability to satisfy several interacting goals simultaneously proves to be important in many contexts. The modification of an already existing program to solve a somewhat different problem has been found to be a powerful approach. We illustrate these concepts with hand simulations of the synthesis of a number of pattern-matching programs.

The direct translation to nondeterministic sequential form leads to a combinatorial explosion of program size before correctness proofs can even begin. The Church-Rosser approach to correctness of asynchronous parallel programs is a flexible way to divide a correctness proof into several lemmas, no one of which requires both deep reasoning and explicit enumeration of all the control states required in the nondeterministic sequential form of the program. The approach is stated and justified abstractly, demonstrated in detail for a simple example program, and compared with other approaches to the correctness of parallel programs. The abstract formulation is independent of the model of parallelism in the example and can also be applied to nondeterminism not derived from asynchronous parallelism.

Axioms and inference rules for partial correctness are given for two parallel programming languages: The General Parallel Language and the Restricted Parallel Language. The General Language is flexible enough to represent most standard synchronizers (e.g. semaphores, events), so that programs using these synchronizers may be verified using the GPL deductive system. However, proofs for GPL programs are in general quite complex. The Restricted Language reduces this complexity by requiring shared variables to be protected by critical sections, so that only one process at a time has access to them. This discipline does not significantly reduce the power of the language, and it greatly simplifies the process of program verification. Although the axioms and inference rules are primarily intended for proofs of partial correctness, there are a number of other important properties of parallel programs. We give some practical techniques which use information obtained from a partial correctness proof to derive other correctness properties, including program termination, mutual exclusion, and freedom from deadlock. A number of examples of such proofs are given. Finally, the axioms and inference rules are shown to be consistent and complete (in a special sense) with respect to an interpretive model of parallel execution. Thus the deductive system gives an accurate description of program execution and is powerful enough to yield a proof of any true partial correctness formula.", "year": "1975", "authors": ["Susan S.

This paper develops the following strategy: to achieve two goals simultaneously, develop a plan to achieve one of them and then modify that plan to achieve the second as well. A systematic program modification technique is presented to support this strategy. The technique requires the introduction of a special \u201cskeleton model\u201d to represent a changing world that can accommodate modifications in the plan. This skeleton model also provides a novel approach to the \u201cframe problem.\u201d The strategy is illustrated by its application to three examples. Two examples involve synthesizing the following programs: interchanging the values of two variables and sorting three variables. The third entails formulating tricky blocks-world plans. The strategy has been implemented in a simple QLISP program. It is argued that skeleton modelling is valuable as a planning technique apart from its use in plan modification, particularly because it facilitates the representation of \u201cinfluential actions\u201d whose effects may be far reaching.

Thus the system is first and foremost an ambiguity resolver; however, the structured representation itself remains available for potential further use in, for example, an MT program. The system is implemented in LTSP 1.5 and applied to ten paragraph length texts. The operation of the system rests on assumptions (1) of the radical sense-ambiguity of the words of natural language texts; and (2) that meaningful texts are coherent because of a certain amount of conceptual repetition they contain, this repetition constituting a discourse structure sufficient to resolve the sense-ambiguity of the text. The semantic rules referred to explicate this conceptual repetition, or closeness, in terms of 'semantic compatibility' between successive fragments of text. In certain cases the system is able to construct a new sense-entry for a word so that the resolution procedure for a paragraph can be completed. Several connections are defined between the conventional logical structure of the arguments contained by the paragraphs and the semantic structure derived by the present system.

The set of rules, called EL, is written in a rule language called ARS. Rules are implemented by ARS as pattern-directed invocation demons monitoring an associative data base. Deductions are performed in an antecedent manner, giving EL's analysis a catch-as-catch-can flavour suggestive of the behavior of expert circuit analyzers. We call this style of circuit analysis propagation of constraints. The system threads deduced facts with justifications which mention the antecedent facts and the rule used. These justifications may be examined by the user to gain insight into the operation of the set of rules as they apply to a problem. The same justifications are used by the system to determine the currently active data-base context for reasoning in hypothetical situations. They are also used by the system in the analysis of failures to reduce the search space.

They are employed in three different, but obviously related roles. Firstly, they are used to specify logics, type systems, operational semantics and other aspects of languages. Secondly, they form the basis for the implementation of such deductive systems. Thirdly, they provide an appropriate language for the formulation and proof of metatheorems of programming languages. The LF Logical Framework [8] has been designed to provide an appropriate language for the high-level specification of deductive systems as they occur in logic and computer science. Its basic principle is often summarized by saying that judgments (the basic unit of deductive systems) are represented as types and deductions as objects. The framework was intentionally kept weak (by excluding, for example, polymorphism and impredicative constructs) in order to better support mechanization and to allow a simple meta-theory. This has proved auspicious: algorithms for unification have been developed [5, 21] and the type theory underlying LF has been amenable to an operational interpretation which is realized in the Elf programming language [18, 19]. Furthermore, it also seems possible to express a wide range of meta-theoretic properties of deductive systems within LF, though this line of research is only in its initial stages [15]. We believe that for all three tasks, specification, implementation, and meta-theory of deductive systems, substantial benefits can be derived from explicit structuring mechanisms for the presentation of such systems. In this paper we make a concrete proposal for a module system for the Elf language which attempts to address those three central issues. Various approaches to the static and dynamic semantics of such a module calculus are possible, but beyond the scope of this paper. Here we provide only informal discussions of the meanings of various language constructs and properties. As an extended example throughout the paper we will use two formulations of minimal propositional calculus with implication and conjunction: an axiom system in the style of Hilbert and Gentzen\u2019s calculus of natural deduction. The problem of modularity in the presentation of theories and logical system has been addressed from the semantical [10, 9] and the type-theoretic [3, 4, 25] point of view. Our design has been guided by these ideas and the pragmatic principles of the ML module system [14, 17].

REASON utilizes the engineering techniques of modelling, decomposition, and analysis by inspection to determine how modules interact to achieve the desired overall behavior of a program.

Recent work of Talcott, Mason, Felleisen, and Moggi establishes a mathematical foundation for studying notions of program equivalence for programming languages with function and control abstractions operating on objects with memory. This work extends work of Landin, Reynolds, Morris and Plotkin. Landin 14] and Reynolds 35] describe high-level abstract machines for deening language semantics. Morris 29] deenes an extensional equivalence relation for the classical lambda calculus. Plotkin 33] extends these ideas to the call-by-value lambda calculus and deenes the operational equivalence relation. Operational approximation is the pre-ordering induced by an operational semantics. Operational equivalence is the equivalence naturally associated with this pre-ordering. One expression operationally approximates another if for all closing program contexts either the rst expression is undeened or both expressions are deened and their values are indistinguishable (with respect to some primitive means of testing equality). Operational approximation and equivalence are congruence relations on expressions and hence closed under substitution and abstraction. Mason and Talcott in 39, 17, 18, 40] study operational approximation and equivalence for subsets of a language with function and control abstractions and objects with memory. Felleisen 8] deenes reduction calculi extending the call-by-value lambda calculus to languages with control and assignment abstractions. These calculi are simpliied and extended by Felleisen and Hieb in 9]. Talcott, Mason, and Felleisen all apply their theories to expressing and proving properties of program constructs and of particular programs. Moggi 27, 28] introduces the notion of computational monad as a framework for axiomatizing features of programming languages. Computational monads are categories with certain additional structure that accommodate a wide variety of language features including assignment, exceptions, and \u2026", "year": "1991", "authors": ["Ian A.

This problem solver and its knowledge base in the application areas of design and electronics are described. The program embodying it is being used to explore the solution of some modest problems in circuit design. It is concluded that shallow reasoning about problem-solver plans is necessary for flexibility, and can be implemented with reasonable efficiency. (Author)", "year": "1976", "authors": ["D.

Management systems seldom meet users'' requirements, are often inappropriate to an application, and are frequently abandoned. But why? Business lacks expertise in the application of computers. Managers who are expert in solving business problems find it difficult to specify formal procedures for the solution of these problems. It is not surprising that programmers who work from poorly defined specifications produce poorly written software. The computer industry has provided only limited support in business applications. Application packages are seldom appropriate to a problem and are often misapplied. Misapplication is the principle reason for their failure in practice situations. Improvements are certainly possible. The manager could be supplied with a system that assists in the design of an application. This system could help the manager specify his requirements by providing him with a framework for thinking about issues relevant to the design of a particular application. The manager might then be better equipped to select a commercial package or to guide in the design of his implementation. This thesis describes a prototype version of such a system. PROCTOR is a program that assists in the design of a hierarchical planning and control system for a procurement firm. PROCTOR is implemented as an \"unstructured\" questionnaire. It guides the user in investigating various aspects of a problem while giving him complete freedom in deciding how and when to supply answers to questions. It allows him to change and skip answers whenever he desires. PROCTOR is implemented in OWL, a system for representing and processing conceptual knowledge. It uses the OWL data base to represent procedures for the questionnaire and to store data accumulated during the iteration. This representation makes possible the presentation of an English-like problem description, various evaluations and the reasons for the evaluations.", "year": "1976", "authors": ["Michael Bosyj"], "refs": []},

The plan representation is of major theoretical interest because it includes not only data flow and control flow relationships between subsegments of a program, but also goal-subgoal, prerequisite, and other logical dependencies between the specifications of the subsegments. Plans are utilized both for describing particular programs and in the compilation of a knowledge base of more abstract knowledge about programming, such as the concept of a loop and various specializations, such as enumeration loops and search loops.

First, the answer to a long-standing open question which had seemed peculiar to automata theory\u2014whether deterministic and nondeterministic polynomial-time-bounded Turing machines are equivalent in power\u2014was seen to be exactly equivalent to determining whether any of several familiar combinatorial problems can be solved by polynomial-time algorithms. Second, the existence of complete problems for NP1 made it possible to replace an entire class of questions by a question about a single representative.Thus all of these combinatorial and automata-theoretic problems were essentially restatements of a single problem, such as: can satisfiability of a propositional formula be decided in polynomial time.\n The main purpose of this paper is to introduce several problems which are complete for P, the class of languages recognizable in deterministic polynomial time. Any such language has the property that if it is recognizable in space logk(\u2022), then every language in P is so recognizable. Thus a problem complete for P will serve to differentiate those sets in P which are not recognizable in logarithmic space from those which are, providing such differentiation is possible.

A Horn set is a set of clauses such that none of its members contains more than one positive literal. A strictly-unit refutation is a proof by contradiction in which no step is justified by applying a rule of inference to a set of clauses all of which contain more than one literal. Horn sets occur in many fields of mathematics such as the theory of groups, rings, Moufang loops, and Henkin models. The usual translation into first-order predicate calculus of the axioms of these and many other fields yields a set of Horn clauses. The striking feature of the Horn property for finite sets of clauses is that its presence or absence can be determined by inspection. Thus, the determination of the applicability of the theorems and procedures of this paper is immediate.\nIn Theorem 1 it is proved that, if S is an unsatisfiable Horn set, there exists a strictly-unit refutation of S employing binary resolution alone, thus eliminating the need for factoring; moreover, one of the immediate ancestors of each step of the refutation is in fact a positive unit clause. A theorem similar to Theorem 1 for paramodulation-based inference systems is proven in Theorem 3 but with the inclusion of factoring as an inference rule. In Section 3 two reduction procedures are discussed. For the first, Chang's splitting, a rule is provided to guide both the choice of clauses and the way in which to split.

In achieving such a system, our pivotal theoretical committment will be to a. view of programs as engineered devices whose analysis can be carried-out at many level of abstraction . The analysis of a program will lead to a set of logical dependencies between modules which explains how and why modules interact to achieve an overall intention. Such a network of dependencies is a teleological structure which we call a plan; the process of elucidating such a plan stucture and showing that it is coherent and\" that. it achieves its overall intended. behavior we call plan verification. Our research will be concerned with the design of a plan. verification programn called REASON. Given a descriiption of the data flow between modules (specified at any level of abstraction), REASON will determine whether or not these modules cooperate to. achieve their intended net behavior. In so doing, REASON elucidates the plan. structure which, in turn, is used as the pivotal data structure in the pertubation analysis necessary for programr evolution, explanation and debugging. ,This approach to program verification will be sharply contrasted with the traditional Floyd.-Hoare systems. which overly restrict themselves to surface features. of the programming language.

In [l] and [lo], techniques are provided for proving such refinements correct. In this article, however, data refinement is applied to specifications of progrums rather than programs themselves. In particular, the weakest (most general) specification of a concrete operation is calculated from the specification of the abstract operation and a posited relation between abstract and concrete values. Early work on proof methods for data refinement can be found in [3] and [6]. Use is made of the weakest precondition in [l]. The idea of calculating specifications is contained in [4,5]. The method presented here is designed for specifications expressed in the Z language [2]. Use is made of the weakest precondition of a specification [8], adapted from [9]. The next section explains what is meant by correctness in this form of data refinement. Section 3 reveals how data refinements can be calculated so that they are automatically correct.

Although there is no standard way to instantiate or use a module, the general idea is that a module describes the implementation of all the values of a given type. We believe that this is too inflexible to provide enough control: one should be able to use different implementations (given by different modules) for variables (and values) of the same type. When incorporated properly into the notation, this finer grain of control allows one to program at a high level of abstraction and then to indicate how various pieces of the program should be implemented. It provides simple, effective access to earlier-written modules, so that they are useable in a more flexible manner than is possible in current notations. It generalizes to provide the ability to indicate structural transformations, in a disciplined fashion, in order to achieve efficiency with respect to time or space. However, the program will still be understood at the abstract level and the transformations or implementations will be looked at only to deal with efficiency concerns. Finally, some so-called \u201cdata types\u201d (e.g. stack and subranges of the integers) can more properly be looked upon simply as restricted implementations of more general types (e.g. sequence and integer ).

The objective is to formalize a notion of program description and to give both plausible (semantic) and effective (syntactic) criteria for the notion of truth of a description. A novel feature of this treatment is the development of the mathematics underlying Floyd-Hoare axiom systems independently of such systems. Other directions that such research might take are also considered. This paper grew out of, and is intended to be usable as, class notes for an introductory semantics course. The three sections of the paper are: 1) A frame work for the logic of programs. Programs and their partial correctness theories are treated as binary relations on states and formulae respectively. Truth-values are assigned to partial correctness assertions in a plausible (Tarskian) but not directly usable way. 2) Particular Programs. Effective criteria for truth are established for some programs using the Tarskian criteria as a benchmark. This leads directly to a sound, complete, effective axiom system for the theories of these programs. The difficulties involved in finding such effective criteria for other programs are explored. 3) Variations and extensions of the framework. Alternatives to binary relations for both programs and theories are speculated on, and their possible roles in semantics are considered. We discuss a hierarchy of varieties of programs and the importance of this hierarchy to the issues of definability and describability. Modal logic is considered as a first-order alternative to Floyd-Hoare logic. We give an appropriate axiom system which is complete for loop-free programs and also puts conventional predicate calculus in a different light by lumping quantifiers with non-logical assignments rather than treating them as logical concepts.", "year": "1976", "authors": ["Vaughan R.

Types, effects and regions are collectively called descriptions.\nExpressions can be abstracted over any kind of description variable -- this permits type, effect and region polymorphism. Unobservable side-effects can be masked by the effect system; an effect soundness property guarantees that the effects computed statically by the effect system are a conservative approximation of the actual side-effects that a given expression may have.\nThe effect system we describe performs certain kinds of side-effect analysis that were not previously feasible.

Glasgow Haskell Compiler (GHC) [1], enables users to write clear specification together with transformation rules, by transforming original codes into efficient ones automatically by rewriting at compile time [4] . However, the patterns in GHC are first order, and too weak to distill the parts of the structure of programs. Higher-order patterns play an important role in program transformation [7], but they are rarely used in functional programming. In this paper, we design a monadic combinator library for program transformation in Haskell. The combinator library uses higher-order patterns as first-class values which can be passed as parameters, constructed by smaller ones in compositional way, returned as values, etc. As a result, our libraries provide more flexible binding than first-order ones, and enables more abstract and modular description of program transformation. Since the combinator is embedded in Haskell, users do not need to learn other languages than Haskell, and enjoy all the benefits of the host language, such as type checking, module system, develop environment, etc. Thanks to the mechanism of Template Haskell [5], all the transformation specified using our libraries are expanded at compile time.

Automatic reasoning about the behaviours of such programs is a challenging problem because the classical techniques (static analysis or model checking) face big scalability issues: the use of the dynamic memory leads to potentially infinite state models. Thus, the specification formalisms used (i.e., Hoare\u2019s logics) has to be able to describe important properties of the dynamic memory and also to allow compositional reasoning which is a key for scalability. The Separation Logic (SL) introduced by Reynolds and O\u2019Hearn [Rey02, BCO04] has such expressiveness and local reasoning properties. However, the entailment checking problem for SL is undecidable in general. Recently, several fragments of SL have been identified to have a decidable entailment checking procedure and still be able to specify programs using interesting data structures, e.g., singly and doubly linked lists [CHO11, PWZ13], nested and overlaid lists [ESS13], and some kind of trees [IRv13]. The techniques used by these decision procedures are various: graph homomorphism in [CHO11, ESS13], reduction to first order logic with reachability and set constraints in [PWZ13], reduction to monadic second order logic in [IRv13]. On other side, efficient techniques based on tree automata have been proposed to specify and reason about programs with dynamic data structures [HHR12]. This internship has as goal to identify a fragment of SL for which the techniques based on graph homomorphism and tree automata may be combined to obtain an efficient decision procedure for the entailment checking problem. This fragment shall include the ones proposed for linked lists (singly, doubly linked and nested) and some restricted kind of trees.

These elements can be presented together because, in this work, we no longer regard a (procedural) programming notation (such as PASCAL) as a notation for expressing a computation; rather, we regard it as a mere extension to the conventional language of logic and set theory. The extension constitutes a convenient (economical) way of expressing certain relational statements. A consequence of this point of view is that the activity of program construction is transformed into that of proof construction. To ensure that this activity of proof construction can be given a sound mechanizable foundation, we present a number of theories in the form of some basic deduction and definition rules. For instance, such theories compose the two logical calculi, a weaker version of the standard Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory, as well as some other elementary mathematical theories leading up to the construction of natural numbers. This last theory acts as a paradigm for the construction of other types such as sequences or trees. Parallel to these mathematical constructions we axiomatize a certain programming notation by giving equivalents to its basic constructs within logic and set theory. A number of other non-logical theories are also presented, which allows us to completely mechanize the calculus of proof that is implied by this framework.", "year": "1984", "authors": ["J. R.

The concept of a congruence closure generalized to sets of ground Horn clauses is central to these completeness results. The first method is general, in that it applies to arbitrary sets of equational Horn clauses, but is not practical, as it assumes a procedure which gives an explicit sequence of substitutions for each E-unifier. A second method uses a procedure enumerating a complete set of E-unifiers, and appears to be well suited to a class of \u201cwell-behaved\u201d equational logic programs which allows a clean and natural integration of the functional and logic-programming paradigms. Using this second method, we have formalized the refutation method used in Eqlog for this class of programs, and a theorem establishes rigorously the completeness of this method.

After an introductory chapter, in chapter 2, we present the method, which admits one-sorted Horn clause programs consisting of any arbitrary Horn clause, including clauses of the form $\\gets B\\sb1,\\dots,B\\sb{n}$, and queries of the form $Q$ = $\\exists x\\sb1\\dots$ $\\exists x\\sb{n}(\\neg H\\sb1\\vee\\cdots\\vee\\neg H\\sb{m})$ where $\\{\\neg H\\sb1,\\dots,H\\sb{m}\\}$ are one-sorted Horn clauses whose sets of variables are disjoint, and where $\\{x\\sb1,\\dots,x\\sb{n}\\}$ is the union of all these variables. This class of formulae can result in answers which are indefinite, in the sense that an answer can consist of a disjunction of substitutions. The method is based on a form of graph-rewriting and a linear-time algorithm for testing the unsatisfiability of propositional Horn formulae. We give constructive proofs of the soundness and completeness of the answer substitution, and show the relationship between the operational semantics of the method and the model-theoretic semantics of the underlying language. In chapter 3, we define an equational extension HORNLOG, the $HE\\sp\\dagger$-refutation method, which applies to many-sorted first-order equational Horn clause programs consisting of clauses of the form $s\\doteq$ t, A $\\gets B\\sb1,\\dots,B\\sb{n},$ or $\\gets B\\sb1,\\dots,B\\sb{n}$ where s and t are first-order terms, A is a non-equational atomic formula, and $B\\sb1,\\dots,B\\sb{n}$ are either equational or non-equational atomic formulae. This class of programs subsumes the paradigms of functional, logic, and equational programming. The method is shown to be complete for E-unification procedures which enumerate a complete set of E-unifiers. In chapter 4 we describe in detail serial implementations of the methods, and consider the design of implementations on a abstract parallel machine.", "year": "1987", "authors": ["Stan Raatz", "Jean H.

Central to the definition is a function taking abstract predicates to concrete ones, and that function, a generalisation of the abstraction function, therefore is a predicative transformers as well.

One of the operators that must be assumed to be primitive in Lisp, independently of any class F, is a conditional operator. The new conditional operator is also defined and it is shown how the Lisp conditional operator can be defined in terms of it whenever there is an element representing the truth value truth in the universe U. The quote operator of Lisp is used to create names for members of U that are symbols, in particular for the symbol T used to represent the truth value truth; the value of the quote operator for a symbol is a name for the symbol. Important purposes can be served by defining the semantics of a programming language by defining an abstract computer for which the programming language is the machine language. These purposes include both a better understanding of the language, as well as of the difficulties that are likely to be faced in implementing it. The chapter explains how a recursive definition of a function can be given to the computer in its machine language and how the computer evaluates such a function for a given argument.", "year": "1959", "authors": ["Paul C.

For an important class of numerical programs, partial evaluation achieves order-of-magnitude speed-ups over conventional Lisp compilation technology.

Diff has been engineered to make efficient use of time and space on typical inputs that arise in vetting version-to-version changes in computer-maintained or computer-generated documents. Time and space usage are observed to vary about as the sum of the file lengths on real data, although they are known to vary as the product of the file lengths in the worst case. The central algorithm of diff solves the \u2018longest common subsequence problem\u2019 to find the lines that do not change between files. Practical efficiency is gained by attending only to certain critical \u2018candidate\u2019 matches between the files, the breaking of which would shorten the longest subsequence common to some pair of initial segments of the two files. Various techniques of hashing, presorting into equivalence classes, merging by binary search, and dynamic storage allocation are used to obtain good performance.

It is based on ideas from several sources[1,2,7,8]. As an example of its work, consider the two files, listed horizontally for brevity: a b c d e f g w a b x y z e It is easy to see that the first file can be made into the second by the following prescription, in which an imaginary line 0 is understood at the beginning of each: append after line 0: w, change lines 3 through 4, which were: c d into: x y z, delete lines 6 through 7, which were: f g. Going the other way, the first file can be made from the second this way: delete line 1, which was: w, change lines 4 through 6, which were: x y z into: c d, append after line 7: f g.

The goal is to investigate automated partitioning of behavior into hardware and software. The design methodology allows gradual, continuous repartitioning of codesign operations during design. For instance, designers might start with an all-software implementation and check the implementation's functionality: they might then refine the implementation over time to a mixed hardware-software implementation. At the system level, the authors use an object-oriented approach to identify the basic objects and associated functions of a system. They divide them into three groups: hardware, software, and codesign . They represent the codesign group's objects and functions using a prototype codesign specification language, Object-Oriented Functional Specifications (OOFS), which lets one describe system state in objects and write object methods as pure functions. Thus, the authors can describe complex systems without biasing the implementation toward hardware or software.<<ETX>>", "year": "1994", "authors": ["Nam S. Woo", "Alfred E. Dunlop", "Wayne H.

To increase our confidence in the reliability projections for SIFT, produced by a Markov reliability model, SRI constructed a formal specification for SIFT, defining the meaning of reliability in the context of flight control. A further series of specifications defined, in increasing detail, the design of SIFT down to pre and post conditions on Pascal code procedures. Mechanically checked mathematical proofs were constructed to demonstrate that the more detailed design specifica- tions for SIFT do indeed imply the formal reliability requirement. An additional specification defined some of the assumptions made about SIFT by the Markov model, and further proofs were constructed to show that these assumptions, as expressed by that specification, did indeed follow from the more detailed design specifications for SIFT.

From the latter, we select two crucial notions: (i) the ability for objects to dynamically change their internal state during the computation; (ii) the structured representation of knowledge, generally obtained via inheritance graphs among classes of objects. We start with the approach, introduced in concurrent logic programming languages, which identifies objects with proof processes and object states with arguments occurring in the goal of a given process. This provides a clean, side-effect free account of the dynamic behavior of objects in terms of the search tree\u2014the only dynamic entity in logic programming languages. We integrate this view of objects with an extension of logic programming, which we call Linear Objects, based on the possibility of having multiple literals in the head of a program clause. This contains within itself the basis for a flexible form of inheritance, and maintains the constructive property of Prolog of returning definite answer substitutions as output of the proof of non-ground goals. The theoretical background for Linear Objects is Linear Logic, a logic recently introduced to provide a theoretical basis for the study of concurrency. We also show that Linear Objects can be considered as constructive restriction of full Classical Logic. We illustrate the expressive power of Linear Objects compared to Prolog by several examples from the object-oriented domain, but we also show that it can be used to provide elegant solutions for problems arising in the standard style of logic programming.", "year": "1990", "authors": ["Jean-Marc Andreoli", "Remo Pareschi"], "refs": ["https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Uniform-Proofs-as-a-Foundation-for-Logic-Miller-Nadathur/6211c8c871270277a37f4c7223c019ca93218803", "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Representing-Objects-in-a-Logic-Programming-with-Hodas-Miller/48e34d1c385dc4e6c2c4cf2038a1bf85b9810a9c", "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/A-Logical-Analysis-of-Modules-in-Logic-Programming-Miller/948802c394993e94110e51fc9fe988850959574f", "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/C-logic-of-complex-objects-Chen-Warren/91683dde8331feeb513a6835d0f425fbb06b54bd", "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Contextual-Logic-Programming-Monteiro-Porto/2f41af183284c4f3d3453fb446eed24c2dd21d43", "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Lexical-Scoping-as-Universal-Quantification-Miller/deba7068faab0cbe4f3e49f7a9093b37d30c3cee", "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Logic-Programming-as-Constructivism-Bry/855d6f1a48306c9fa64b67c17fa450dafee0907c", "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Logic-Programming-with-Sequent-Systems%2C-A-Linear-Andreoli-Pareschi/c73acfd80e3e7db1407e39ea0a58251846f47a3a", "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Polka%3A-a-parlog-object-oriented-language-Davison/ccc9660a122aaaeb72eb0ac1b6e15dcab2174f0f"]},

Such an intense planning effort requires integrated design methodologies that cover the entire system development life cycle-from problem definition to final testing-and span the traditional hardware/software boundaries. Furthermore, to be effective, these methodologies must be specialized to the particular application, technology, and organization. When developing such methodologies, we need to consider a number of issues. The first is that the application drives the methodology. For example, designers must deal with response-time requirements in real-time systems, the validation of security kernels in information systems, and special test procedures for systems that do not allow \"fixes\" during deployment (such as spacecraft, satellites, and certain weapons). Second, methodologies must exploit available technology to enhance both design productivity and quality. Program generators and microprocessor-based architectures are examples of such exploitation for business data processing and industrial control. Finally, we must remember that if corporate resources such as available manpower, the training and experience of personnel, available support tools, and project management practices are not taken into account during design, the resulting methodology will be severely limited. In this article we discuss a total system design (TSD) framework that supports the development of integrated system design methodologies. Issues that must be addressed during system development are identified and presented in a helpful structure (1) to aid in our understanding of the design process, (2) to serve as a foundation for the development of new methodologies, and (3) to provide a means for methodology analysis and selection. The TSD framework's broad scope makes it useful in establishing company-wide system-development standards, even for organizations whose concerns span several application areas. The framework is compatible with Department of Defense standards 1 and with research results described in various sources of professional literature. Our presentation of the TSD framework begins with an overview of its stages, phases and steps, followed by a discussion of hardware-software trade-offs. We then show the development of a system design methodology for a particular type of company and a particular application area.

The traditional formalisms for reasoning about programs abstract away from quantitative time and, consequently, are inadequate for reasoning about real-time systems. We extend the methods based on automata and temporal logics to allow them to model timing delays and to verify real-time requirements. \nWe introduce timed automata to model the behavior of real-time systems over time. Our definition provides a simple, and yet powerful, way to annotate state-transition graphs with timing constraints using finitely many real-valued clocks. We study timed automata from the perspective of formal language theory: we consider closure properties, decision problems, and subclasses. \nWe present two conservative extensions of the existing temporal logics to allow them to specify timing properties. The metric interval temporal logic (MITL) uses linear-time semantics, and its syntax allows temporal operators to be subscripted with intervals restricting their scope in time. The timed computation tree logic (TCTL) uses branching-time semantics, and its syntax provides access to time through a novel kind of time quantifier. \nIn the proposed verification method, a finite-state system is modeled as a composition of timed automata, and the correctness is specified either as a deterministic timed automaton, or as a formula of MITL or TCTL. In each case we develop an algorithm for model checking. The distinguishing feature of our work is the use of the set of reals to model time; we argue that the denseness of the time domain is crucial for modeling event-driven asynchronous systems.

The process that finds the true productions on every cycle is most in need of improvement; even in today's small systems this process is often expensive and it is likely to become more expensive if productions systems become larger. There are a number of possible ways to achieve the greater efficiency, including taking advantage of the slow rate of change of the data base, taking advantage of similarities in structure of the antecedent conditions of productions, expending a minimum of effort on false antecedent conditions, avoiding whenever possible the operations that are likely to be most time consuming, and making efficient use of hardware. Since computer power is achieved most economically today through parallelism, no algorithm can be truly efficient in its use of hardware unless it can be executed in parallel. A production system monitor has been implemented that responds in a reasonable manner to both the peculiar nature of the task and the realities of current hardware technology.

The resulting theory of timed state sequences is shown to be decidable, albeit nonelementary, and its expressive power is characterized by ?-regular sets. Several more expressive variants are proved to be highly undecidable. This framework allows us to classify a wide variety of real-time logics according to their complexity and expressiveness. Indeed, it follows that most formalisms proposed in the literature cannot be decided. We are, however, able to identify two elementary real-time temporal logics as expressively complete fragments of the theory of timed state sequences, and we present tableau-based decision procedures for checking validity.

That algorithm combines model-checking algorithm of this paper with model-checking for discrete-time Markov chains. To apply our algorithm to verify any practical system, we must devise ways to cope with the PSPACE complexity of the problem. Recently heuristics to implement CTL model-checking without explicitly enumerating all the states have been proposed. For instance, Burch et.al. 11] propose the use of binary decision diagrams to represent large state sets symbolically. Henzinger et.al. 21] have shown how to extend these symbolic methods to model-checking of TCTL formulas.

We thank him as well as Thomas Henzinger, Harry Lewis, Zohar Manna, and Moshe Vardi for helpful discussions. 30 also, and has been studied in 2]; let us call this extension TCTL q. The syntax of TCTL q uses the time quantiiers which allow references to the times of states, and admits the addition of timing constraints; that is, atomic formulas that relate the times of diierent states. As timing constraints, we permit comparisons of clock values, possibly with addition of constants. The formulas of TCTL q are built from propositions and timing constraints by connectives, CTL temporal operators, and time quantiiers. Note that the logic TCTL q is strictly more expressive than TCTL. For example, consider the formula: 93x: p ^ 93 (q ^ 93z: (r ^ z < x + 5))] It says: \\there exists a computation path with a p-state followed by a q-state, followed by an r-state, which is within 5 time units from the p-state.\" No formula of TCTL speciies this property. The model-checking algorithm can be modiied to handle formulas of TCTL q 2]. This is done by introducing additional clocks, one per each temporal operator in the TCTL q-formula, while constructing the region graph. Recall that, in contrast, only one additional clock suuces to check any TCTL-formula.

This declaration, along with a goal-continuation passing style of programming is adequate to model the state of objects. We also examine a few aspects of how having objects embedded in logic programming can be used to enrich the notion of object: for examples, objects may be partial (that is, may contain free variables) and non-deterministic, and it is possible not only to search for objects with certain properties but also to do hypothetical reasoning with them.", "year": "1990", "authors": ["Joshua S.

A proof-theoretic characterization of logical languages that form suitable bases for Prolog-like programming languages is provided. This characterization is based on the principle that the declarative meaning of a logic program, provided by provability in a logical system, should coincide with its operational meaning, provided by interpreting logical connectives as simple and fixed search instructions. The operational semantics is formalized by the identification of a class of cut-free sequent proofs called uniform proofs. A uniform proof is one that can be found by a goal-directed search that respects the interpretation of the logical connectives as search instructions. The concept of a uniform proof is used to define the notion of an abstract logic programming language, and it is shown that first-order and higher-order Horn clauses with classical provability are examples of such a language. Horn clauses are then generalized to hereditary Harrop formulas and it is shown that first-order and higher-order versions of this new class of formulas are also abstract logic programming languages if the inference rules are those of either intuitionistic or minimal logic.

PSs are rule-based architectures that have been used successfully for tasks ranging from models of human behavior to large application systems in chemistry and medicine, to classical artificial intelligence programs. The question studied by this thesis is whether a PS architecture (PSA) helps or hinders with respect to implementation problems encountered by Hearsay-II(HSII), a large artificial intelligence system for understanding speech, developed at Carnegie-Mellon University (CMU). This is an important question because many of these problems, such as efficiency, compensating for error, controlling directionality, augmenting knowledge, and analyzing performance, have become limiting factors for performance. To obtain an answer to this question, an actual system (called HSP, for HearSay-Production system) was implemented on C.mmp, the CMU multi-miniprocessor, with a portion of th HSII speech knowledge translated into productions. An early decision was made to maintain close comparability of HSP with HSII rather than explore the more general question of how to best understand speech with a PS. Two knowledge- source (KS) programs from a complete HSII configuration were completely translated and run in HSP, and these provide a basis for some detailed comparisons between HSII and HSP.

This paper extends model-checking for the branching-time logic CTL to the analysis of real-time systems, whose correctness depends on the magnitudes of the timing delays. For specifications, we extend the syntax of CTL to allow quantitative temporal operators such as ?? <5, meaning \"possibly within 5 time units.\" The formulas of the resulting logic, Timed CTL (TCTL), are interpreted over continuous computation trees, trees in which paths are maps from the set of nonnegative reals to system states. To model finite-state systems we introduce timed graphs-state-transition graphs annotated with timing constraints. As our main result, we develop an algorithm for model-checking, for determining the truth of a TCTL-formula with respect to a timed graph. We argue that choosing a dense domain instead of a discrete domain to model time does not significantly blow up the complexity of the model-checking problem. On the negative side, we show that the denseness of the underlying time domain makes the validity problem for TCTL ?11-hard.

The constant c is, in a sense, given a scope: it is introduced to solve this goal and is \u201cdischarged\u201d after the goal succeeds or fails. This interpretation is similar to the interpretation of implicational goals: the goal D \u2283 G should succeed if when D is assumed, the goal G succeeds. The assumption D is discharged after G succeeds or fails. An interpreter for a logic programming language containing both universal quantifiers and implications in goals and the body of clauses is described. In its non-deterministic form, this interpreter is sound and complete for intuitionistic logic. Universal quantification can provide lexical scoping of individual, function, and predicate constants.

Syntactically, the language is an extension of Datalog (function-free Horn logic) which allows rules themselves to appear in the bodies of other rules. Such rules are called embedded implications. Several researchers have studied restricted versions of these rules, but in their full incarnation, universal quantiiers may appear in the premises, as in the rule A 8 x B(x) C(x)]. This paper focuses on these embedded universal quantiiers. It is shown, for instance, that such quantiiers give the logic the ability to create new constant symbols hypothetically during inference. This, in turn, allows the logic to simulate unbounded counters and arbitrary Turing machines. In addition, when the logic is augmented with negation-as-failure, it becomes expressively complete , that is, it can express any database query which is typed and generic.

Instruction and close interaction with the system as it behaves are preferred over a longer feedback loop with more independent learning by the system. The domain is initially an abstract job shop. The beginning system has capabilities for solving problems,, processing language, building productions, and interacting with the task environment. All parts of the system are subject to instruction. The main problem-solving strategy, which permeates all four system components, is based on means ends analysis and goal-subgoal search.

To provide data on which to base the development of sampling methods and parameter estimation techniques, pin-level fault-injection was conducted on the FTMP computer. Detection time was chosen for statistical analysis because it accounted for most of the variation in total recovery time. Stuck-at-zero, stuck-at-one, and inverted faults were injected on each of six pins, yielding 18 data sets. The data sets fell into groups of detection behavior; however, none of the factors that were varied in the experiment\u00bffault type, pin, chip, or board\u00bfacounted for the groupings. While no single distribution was shown to be the best fit to all the data sets, of greater importance is that the exponential distribution was a bad fit to all data sets.

As hardware cost and size continue to drop and processing requirements become well-understood in areas such as signal and image processing, more special-purpose systems are being constructed. However, since most of these systems are built on an ad hoc basis for specific tasks, methodological work in this area is rare. Because the knowledge gaited from individual experiences is neither accumulated nor properly organized, the same errors are repeated. I/O and computation imbalance is a notable example-often, the fact that I/O interfaces cannot keep up with device speed is discovered only after constructing a high-speed, special-purpose device. We intend to help correct this ad hoc approach by providing a general guideline-specifically, the concept of systolic architecture, a general methodology for mapping high-level computations into hardware structures. In a systolic system, data flows from the computer memcory in a rhythmic fashion, passing through many processing elements before it returns to memory, much as blood circulates to and from the heart. The system works like an autombbile assembly line where different people work on the same car at different times and many cars are assembled simultaneously. An assembly line is always linear, however, and systolic systems are sometimes two-dimensional. They can be rectangular, triangular, or hexagonal to make use of higher degrees of parallelism. Moreover, to implement a variety of computations, data flow in a systolic system may be at multiple speeds in multiple directions-both inputs and (partial) results flow, whereas only results flow in classical pipelined systems. Generally speaking, a systolic system is easy to implement because of its regularity and easy to reconfigure (to meet various outside constraints) because of its modularity. The systolic architectural concept was developed at Carnegie-Mellon University,'17 and versions of systolic processors are being designed and built by several industrial and governmental organizations.840 This article reviews the basic principle of systolic architectures and explains why they should result in cost-effective, highperformance special-purpose systems for a wide range of problems.", "year": "1982", "authors": ["H.

The rootfinding algorithm was chosen because it meets two constraints: it is a parallel algorithm with significant interprocess communication; and it is of relatively low complexity, enabling us to focus on implementation issues rather than subtleties in the algorithm itself. Variations in processor speeds and asynchronously executing operating system functions are shown to have a detrimental effect on the rootfinder's performance. However, the most important implementation decision affecting the performance of the rootfinding program is the type of synchronization semaphore used. We define the threshold for practical application of a semaphore to be when 50% of the execution time is attributed to semaphore related overheads. Using the 50% criteria, we measured thresholds for inter-synchronization times from two milliseconds for the most primitive locks, to 200 milliseconds for the most sophisticated and flexible semaphore. During the course of these measurements, Hydra underwent several revisions and the 200 millisecond threshold was reduced to 33 milliseconds. The principal concept responsible for this performance improvement is discussed in the paper.", "year": "1978", "authors": ["Peter Neil Oleinick", "Samuel H. Fuller"], "refs": []},

Several researchers have developed logical systems along these lines, but the complexity and expressibility of such logics is only now being explored. It has been shown, for instance, that the data-complexity of these logics is <italic>PSPACE</italic>-complete in the function-free, predicate case. This paper extends this line of research by developing syntactic restrictions with lower complexity. These restrictions are based on two ideas from Horn-clause logic: <italic>linear recursion</italic> and <italic>stratified negation</italic>. In particular, a notion of stratification is developed in which negation-as-failure alternates with linear recursion. The complexity of such rulebases depends on the number of layers of stratification. The result is a hierarchy of syntactic classes which corresponds exactly in the polynomial-time hierarchy of complexity classes. In particular, rulebases with <italic>k</italic> strata are data-complete for &Sgr;<supscrpt><italic>P</italic></supscrpt><subscrpt><italic>h</italic></subscrpt>. Furthermore, these rulebases provide a complete characterization of the relational queries in &Sgr;<supscrpt><italic>P</italic></supscrpt><subscrpt><italic>h</italic></subscrpt>.

The verification of such an abstraction consists of showing that its implementation behaves in accordance with its public specifications; the abstraction can then be used with confidence in constructing other programs, and the verification of that use employs only the public specifications.\n This paper introduces Alphard by developing and verifying a data structure definition and a program that uses it.

The problem is to devise an algorithm in which processors communicate their own values and relay values received from others that allows each nonfaulty processor to infer a value for each other processor.

By triangularization, many matrix problems are reduced to the simpler problem of solving triangular- linear systems (see for example, Stewart). When X is a square matrix, triangularization is the major step in almost all direct methods for solving general linear systems. When M is restricted to be an orthogonal matrix Q, triangularization is also the key step in computing least squares solutions by the QR decomposition, and in computing eigenvalues by the QR algorithm. Triangularization is computationally expensive, however. Algorithms for performing it typically require n3 operations on general n x n matrices. As a result, triangularization has become a bottleneck in some real-time applications.11 This paper sketches unified concepts of using systolic arrays to perform real-time triangularization for both general and band matrices.

In this paper it is shown that cellular arrays are inherently well suited for the solution of many graph problems. For example, the adjacency matrix of a graph is easily mapped onto an array; each matrix element is stored in one cell of the array, and typical row and column operations are readily implemented by simple cell logic. A major challenge in the effective use of cellular arrays for the solution of graph problems is the determination of algorithms that exploit the possibilities for parallelism, especially for problems whose solutions appear to be inherently serial. In particular, several parallelized algorithms are presented for the solution of certain spanning tree, distance, and path problems, with direct applications to wire routing, PERT chart analysis, and the analysis of many types of networks. These algorithms exhibit a computation time that in many cases grows at a rate not exceeding log2 n, where n is the number of nodes in the graph.

We give an algorithm that produces VLSI layouts for classes of graphs that have good separator theorems. We show in particular that any planar graph of n vertices has an O(n lg-square(n)) area layout and that any tree of n vertices can be laid out in linear area.

It is argued that conglomerates include all parallel machines which could feasibly be built with fixed connections. Basic interconnection patterns are also investigated in an attempt to pin down the notion of parallel time to within a constant factor. To this end, a universal structure is developed which can simulate any other basic interconnection pattern within linear time.

It is based on the layout procedure which lays out a graph by bisecting the graph, recursively laying out the two halves, and then combining the two sublayouts. The area of the layout is related to the number of edges that must be cut to bisect the graph. For the shuffle-exchange graph on n vertices, we present a bisection schema for which the above procedure yields an O(n-squared/lg n) area layout when n = 2 to the K power and k is a power of two. The bisection involves a mapping from vertices of the graph to polynomials, and the polynomials are subsequently evaluated at complex roots of unity. Incidental to this construction is a result on the combinatorial problem of necklace enumeration. (Author)", "year": "1980", "authors": ["Dan Hoey", "Charles E.

Physiologists use the work 'systole' to refer to the rhythmically recurrent contraction of the heart and arteries which pulses blood through the body. In a systolic computing system, the function of a processor is analogous to that of the heart. Every processor regularly pumps data in and out, each time performing some short computation, so that a regular flow of data is kept up in the network. Many basic matrix computations can be pipelined elegantly and efficiently on systolic networks having an array structure. As an example, hexagonally connected processors can optimally perform matrix multiplication. Surprisingly, a similar systolic array can compute the LU-decomposition of a matrix. These systolic arrays enjoy simple and regular communication paths, and almost all processors used in the networks are identical. As a result, special purpose hardware devices based on systolic arrays can be built inexpensively using the VLSI technology. (Author)", "year": "1978", "authors": ["H. T. Kung", "Charles E.

First, we could produce a PLA (programmable logic array) of approximate dimensions 4n \u00d7 4n by representing the states directly by columns, rather than coding the states in binary. This approach, while theoretically suboptimal, makes use of carefully developed technology and, because of the care with which PLA implementation has been done, may be the preferred technique in many real situations.

The arithmetic circuits are readily multiplexed to process multiple data inputs or to effect multiple, but different, filters (or both), thus providing for efficient hardware utilization. Up to 100 filter sections can be multiplexed in audio-frequency applications using presently available digital circuits in the medium-speed range. The filters are also easily modified to realize a wide range of filter forms, transfer functions, multiplexing schemes, and round-off noise levels by changing only the contents of the read-only memory and/or the timing signals and the length of the shift-register delays.

It outlines the principles and most important techniques of model-based residual generation using parameter identification and state estimation methods with emphasis upon the latest attempts to achieve robustness with respect to modelling errors. A solution to the fundamental problem of robust fault detection, providing the maximum achievable robustness by decoupling the effects of faults from each other and from the effects of modelling errors, is given. This approach not only completes the theory but is also of great importance for practical applications. For the case where the prerequisites for complete decoupling are not given, two approximate solutions\u2014one in the time domain and one in the frequency domain\u2014are presented, and the crossconnections to earlier approaches are evidenced. The resulting observer schemes for robust instrument fault detection, component fault detection, and actuator fault detection are briefly discussed.

This technique, known as hybrid redundancy, consists of N identical modules connected to a majority voter to form an NMR core. Disagreement detectors instruct a switch to replace any of the N modules that disagree with the majority consensus by a standby spare. The switch is essential to the operation of the hybrid redundancy scheme. The system reliability is a product of the reliabilities of the switch and the hybrid redundancy scheme assuming a perfect switch. To realize the demonstrated potential of the latter a highly reliable, thus simple, switch is required. An iterative cell switch is proposed and demonstrated to save at least 25 percent, and more than 80 percent in some instances, of the complexity of a switch design presented elsewhere in the literature. The use of threshold, rather than majority, voters is considered and shown to yield a simpler design in some cases. Three techniques for decreasing the propagation delay through the iterative cell switch are presented as well as a scheme to implement retry of failed modules. Finally, five different switch designs are compared on a cost and complexity basis.", "year": "1973", "authors": ["Daniel P. Siewiorek", "Edward J.

The specific application of the method is to the Skylab which contains three double-gimbaled control moment gyros for precise attitude control and maneuvering. It is assumed that the attitude reference is inertially fixed and that two of the vehicle principal moments of inertia are much larger than the third. Gravity gradient torques and resultant angular momentum accumulation are developed for small deviations from the reference. The assumed moment-of-inertia distribution allows desaturation about all axes with only two attitude angles each for the two axes with large moments of inertia. The necessary desaturation maneuvers can be decoupled for a special set of orbital coordinates. All maneuvers are made during the night portion of the orbit, and the percentage utilized for desaturation is selectable. Expressions for the attitude angle commands are developed assuming infinite vehicle rates. The effect of finite rates introduces an efficiency into the desaturation. Expressions for this efficiency are developed and means for compensation are treated. Arbitrary misalignments between geometric vehicle axes and principal moment-of-inertia axes are permissible. An angle bias about the sun line minimizes the angular momentum accumulation about the sun line projection into the orbital plane. Adaptive desaturation maneuver limiting consistent with the available maneuver momentum is included.", "year": "1971", "authors": ["Hans F. Kennel"], "refs": []},

The primary objective of a local area network (LAN) is tpor ovide high-speed data transfer among a group of nodes consisting of data-processing terminals, controllers, or computers within the confines ofa building or campus environment. The network should be easily accessible, extremely reliable, and extendible in both function and physical size. The rapid advances in computing and communications technology over the last two decades have led to several different transmission schemes and media types that could be used in these networks. The star/ring wiring topology with token-access control has emerged as a technology that can meet all of these objectives. The requirements of small networks with just a few nodes, as well as those of very large networks with thousands of nodes, can be achieved through this one architecture. This paper is a tutorial of the fundamental aspects of the architecture, physical components, and operation of a token-ring LAN. Particular emphasis is placed on the fault detection and isolation capabilities that are possible, as well as the aspects that allow for mtwork expansion andgrowth.

First the problem is stated, an overview of previous work is given, and the results of the investigation are summarized. Then several current computer component technologies are appraised and the assumption in reliability models of a Poisson failure distribution for these components is justified. Next, the development of several algorithms for the generation and evaluation of diagnostic test pattersns for computer circuits is described. These algorithms are illustrated by examples and by detailed APL programs. Next, mathematical reliability evaluation models for a variety of functional computer units are devised, their APL programming implementation given, and their use in the design process illustrated. The effects of failure coverage, duty cycle, number of spares, failure tolerance, lower component failure rate with power off, and other parameters are tabulated and delineated. Last, the architecture and operation of an automatically repaired computer at different levels of organization is described, including failure tolerant storage, ROS, and arithmetic logical organs. The design of reconfiguration switches, status registers, and a fully checked decoder is also given. By employing these techniques, which require about 2.5 times as much hardware as an equivalent simplex computer, it is possible to gain the same benefits as would be produced by a 600 fold decrease in component failure rates.

The study of overload noise in DPCM may be abstracted to the following stochastic processes problem. Let the input to the system be a Gaussian stochastic process {x(t)} with a bandlimited (0, \u222b 0 ) spectrum F(f). Denote the output of the system by y(t). Most of the time y(t) is equal to x(t). During time intervals of this kind, the absolute value of the derivative x'(t) = dx(t)/dt is less than a given positive constant x' 0 . (In a DPCM system, x' 0 = kf. where k is the maximum level of the quantizer and \u222b s is the sampling frequency.) There are time intervals, I i (t(i) 0 , t(i) 1 ) (i = 0, \u00b1 1, \u00b12, \u2026), for which y(t) \u2260 x(t). These time intervals begin at time instants t(i) 0 such that | x'(t(i) 0 ) | increases through the value x' 0 . For t \u220a I i , y(t) = x(t(i) 0 ) + (t \u2212 t(i) 0 )x' 0 . The interval ends at t(i) 1 , when x(t) and y(t) become equal again. The overload noise in the DPCM system is defined to be n(t) = x(t) \u2212 y(t). The problem is to study the random process {n(t)}. In the present paper, we will give an upper bound to the average noise power $\\langle n^{2}(t)\\rangle_{av}$ which at the same time is a very good approximation to the noise power itself. Two previous attempts have been made to find $\\langle n^{2}(t)\\rangle_{av}$ . One, due to Rice and O'Neal, involves an approximation valid only for very large x' 0 . Another approach to the problem, due to Zetterberg, includes an ingenious way of avoiding the determination of t(i) 1 . A new approach is given here that combines the best features of the two methods. The present result is a better approximation for slope overload noise than has been previously obtained. The result differs from previous results but is asymptotically equal to that given by Rice and O'Neal for x' 0 \u2192 \u221e.

A drawback to conventional polling techniques for local distribution is excessive overhead. Thus, in systems with many lightly loaded terminals, message delay is more a function of the time required to poll all terminals than of traffic from competing sources. A technique for reducing overhead is presented together with the results of analysis and simulation. The technique identifies terminals having messages by a process of elimination starting with a poll of groups of terminals. Further, the technique is adaptive in that the sizes of groups to be polled are chosen according to the probability of a terminal having a message. The object of the adaptivity is to minimize the average time required to examine all terminals. The results of analysis and simulation show considerable reduction in this average for systems with many lightly loaded terminals. Moreover, the adaptive feature insures that there is no penalty for heavy loading. With reduced overhead there is a reduction in the average delay of messages.", "year": "1978", "authors": ["Joseph Francis Hayes"], "refs": []},

In this paper, we illustrate that rewrite systems and strategies for higher-order term rewriting, which includes the usual notion of first-order rewriting, can be naturally specified and implemented in a higher-order logic programming language. We adopt a notion of higherorder rewrite system which uses the simply typed \u03bb-calculus as the language for expressing rules, with a restriction on the occurrences of free variables on the left hand sides of rules so that matching of terms with rewrite templates is decidable. The logic programming language contains an implementation of the simply-typed lambda calculus including \u0392\u03b7-conversion and higher-order unification. In addition, universal quantification in queries and the bodies of clauses is permitted. For higher-order rewriting, we show how these operations implemented at the meta-level provide elegant mechanisms for the object-level operations of descending through terms and matching terms with rewrite templates.

Tow schemes for simplifying quantifier alternation, called Skolemization and raising (a dual of Skolemization), are presented. In this setting where variables of functional type can be quantified and not all types contain closed terms, the naive generalization of first-order Skolemization has several technical problems that are addressed. The method of searching for pre-unifiers described by Huet is easily extended to the mixed prefix setting, although solving flexible-flexible unification problems is undecidable since types may be empty.

Although one intuitively knows how to use these systems and recognise correct derivations, there is no definitive account which captures this intuition. It is therefore natural to seek a framework for representing logics, which unifies the structure common to all logical systems. We introduce such a framework, called ELF and based on the Edinburgh Logical Framework (ELF). The major advantage of ELF is that it allows us to give precise definitions of representation. Such definitions are not possible with ELF since information is lost during encoding; the adequacy theorems of ELF representations are only applicable to particular encodings and cannot be generalised. We rectify this deficiency using the extra distinctions between terms provided by the universes of a pure type system which yields a simple presentation of the type theory of ELF. To do this, we extend these type systems to include signatures and /3ij-equivalence. Using the ideas underlying representation in ELF+, we give a standard presentation of the logics under consideration, based on Martin-L\u00f6f's notion of judgements and Aczel's work on Frege structures. This presentation forms a reference point from which to investigate representations in ELF; it is not itself a framework since we do not specify a logic using a finite amount of information. Logics which do not fit this pattern are particularly interesting as they are more difficult, if not impossible, to encode. The syntactic definitions of representations have an elegant algebraic formulation which utilises the abstract view of logics as consequence relations. The properties of the ELF entailment relation determine the behaviour of the vanables and consequence relations of the logics under consideration. Encodings must preserve this common structure. This motivates the presentation of the logics and their corresponding type theories as strict indexed categories (or split fibrations) so that encodings give rise to indexed functors. The syntactic notions of representation now have a simple formulation as indexed isomorphisms.", "year": "1992", "authors": ["Philippa Gardner"], "refs": []},

It is motivated by the desire to identify what, if any, are the difficulties created purely by locality of state, independent of other properties such as side-effects, exceptional termination and nontermination due to recursion. We consider a simple language (equivalent to a fragment of Standard ML) of typed, higher order functions that can dynamically create fresh names. Names are created with local scope, can be tested for equality and can be passed around via function application, but that is all. We demonstrate that despite the simplicity of the language and its operational semantics, the observable properties of such functions can be very subtle. Two methods are introduced for analyzing Morris-style observational equivalence between expressions in the language. The first method introduces a notion of \u2018applicative\u2019 equivalence incorporating a syntactic version of O\u2019Hearn and Tennent\u2019s relationally parametric functors and a version of representation independence for local names. This applicative equivalence is properly contained in the relation of observational equivalence, but coincides with it for first order expressions (and is decidable there). The second method develops a general, categorical framework for computationally adequate models of the language, based on Moggi\u2019s monadic approach to denotational semantics. We give examples of models, one of which is fully abstract for first order expressions. No fully abstract (concrete) model of the whole language is known.

The second stage extends the logic to include classes and class membership. The logic we present provides an expressive language for deening and studying properties of programs including program equivalences, in a uniform framework. The logic combines the features and beneets of equational calculi as well as program and speciication logics. In addition to the usual rst-order formula constructions, we add contextual assertions. Contextual assertions generalize Hoare's triples in that they can be nested, used as assumptions, and their free variables may be quantiied. They are similar in spirit to program modalities in dynamic logic. We use the logic to establish the validity of the Meyer Sieber examples in an operational setting. The theory allows for the construction of inductively deened sets and derivation of the corresponding induction principles.

In Section VI, we show that this bound implies that certain moments of the distribution of the computation per digit are infinite, and we determine lower bounds to the rates above which these moments diverge. In most cases, our bounds coincide with previously known upper bounds to rates above which the moments converge.

The language extends traditional logic programming languages by replacing first-order terms with simply-typed $\\lambda$-terms, replacing first-order unification with higher-order unification, and allowing implication and universal quantification in queries and the bodies of clauses. Inference rules for a variety of proof systems can be naturally specified in this language. The higher-order features of the language contribute to a concise specification of provisos concerning variable occurrences in formulas and the discharge of assumptions present in many proof systems. In addition, abstraction in meta-terms allows the construction of terms representing object level proofs which capture the notions of abstractions found in many proof systems. The operational interpretations of the connectives of the language provide a set of basic search operations which describe goal-directed search for proofs. \nTo emphasize the generality of the meta-language, we compare it to another general specification language: the Logical Framework (LF). We describe a translation which compiles a specification of a logic in LF to a set of formulas of our meta-language, and prove this translation correct. \nA direct specification of inference rules provides a declarative account of a proof system and a specification of the process of searching for proofs, but generally does not implement a theorem prover that can be executed directly. We show that it is sometimes possible to obtain a theorem prover that is complete under depth-first control by making only slight modifications to a specification. For the purpose of general theorem proving, we show how tactics and tacticals, which provide a framework for high-level control over search, can be directly implemented in our extended language. This framework serves as a starting point for implementing theorem provers and proof systems that can integrate many diversified operations on formulas and proofs for various logics. \nWe present an extensive set of examples that have been implemented in the higher-order logic programming language $\\lambda$Prolog.", "year": "1989", "authors": ["Amy P.

So, some of them have to be evaluated on this new state. The evaluation of an integrity constraint can be time consuming, but one can improve such an evaluation by taking advantage from the fact that the integrity constraint is satisfied in the current state. Indeed, it is then possible to derive a simplified form of this integrity constraint which is sufficient to evaluate in the new state in order to determine whether the initial constraint is still satisfied in this new state. The purpose of this paper is to present a simplification method yielding such simplified forms for integrity constraints. These simplified forms depend on the nature of the updating operation which is the cause of the state change. The operations of inserting, deleting, updating a tuple in a relation as well as transactions of such operations are considered.

This method provides an abstract and mathematically elegant means of analyzing the invariant properties of unification in various settings by providing a clean separation of the logical issues from the specification of procedural information. Our major contribution is three-fold. First, we have extended the Herbrand-Martelli-Montanari method of transformations on systems to higher-order unification and pre-unification; second, we have used this formalism to provide a more direct proof of the completeness of a method for higher-order unification than has previously been available; and, finally, we have shown the completeness of the strategy of eager variable elimination. In addition, this analysis provides another justification of the design of Huet's procedure, and shows how its basic principles work in a more general setting.

However, implementing a proof environment for a specific logical system is both complex and time-consuming, this-together with the proliferation of logics-suggests that a uniform and reliable alternative is desirable. One such alternative is the Edinburgh Logical Framework (LF), developed in the late eighties at the LFCS (Laboratory for Foundations of Computer Science). The LF is a logic-independent tool which, given a specification for a logical system, synthesizes a proof editor and checker for that system. Its specification language is based on a general theory of logics, which enables one to capture uniformities and idiosyncrasies of a large class of logics without sacrificing generality for tractability. Peculiarities (such as side conditions on rule application, variable occurrence or formula formation) are expressed at the level of the specification. In this paper we are going to provide a broad illustration of its applicability and discuss to what extent it is successful. The analysis (of the formal presentation) of a system carried out through encoding often illuminates the system itself.

Recently, the variable has come under attack. The proponents of \"functional programming\" have argued that variables are at the root of all our problems in programming. They claim that we must rid our languages of all manifestations of the \"vonNeumann bottleneck\" and learn to live in the changeless world of functional combinators.While we may not, believe all the claims of the functional programming advocates, there is evidence that the treatment of variables in most programming languages leaves much to be desired. In this paper we discuss how to make variables \"abstract\", i.e., how to introduce the notion of variable in to a language so that variables have reasonable mathematical properties. This paper includes:--- a discussion of language design principles that allow a more mathematical treatment of variables in programming language, and--- a description of an equational logic for the programming language Russell [Boehm80]. Although this logic follows much of the development of abstract data types (cf. [Guttag78]), it is novel in its treatment of a language in which expressions not only produce values but also can have effects. We discuss the over all structure of the logic and present in detail the rules particularly relevant to the semantics of variables. A complete presentation of the logic appears in [Demers82], and the rule numbers in this paper agree with the numbers used there.In the next section, we discuss the underlying language principles needed to make an equational specification of variables possible.

We focus on F\u2264, a second order lambda calculus with bounded quantification, which is rich enough to make the problem interesting. We define a normalizing rewrite system on the proofs, in which different proofs of the same typing judgement are transformed in a unique normal proof, and in which normal proofs of judgements assigning different types to the same term are strongly related. This rewriting system is not defined on the proofs themselves but on the terms of an auxiliary type system, in which the terms carry a complete information about their typing proof. This technique gives also a simple proof of the existence of a minimum type for each term.

The appropriate notion of subcategory is an indexed (or better fibred) one, see 0.1. Another point that needs attention is the definition of completeness (see 0.2). In my talk at the Church\u2019s Thesis meeting, and in the first draft of this paper, I claimed too strong a form of completeness for the internal category. (The elementary oversight is described in 2.7.) Fortunately during the writing of [13] my collaborators Edmund Robinson and Giuseppe Rosolini noticed the mistake. Again one needs to pay careful attention to the ideas of indexed (or fibred) categories. The idea that small (sufficiently) complete categories in toposes might exist, and would provide the right setting in which to discuss models for strong polymorphism (quantification over types), was suggested to me by Eugenio Moggi. And he first realized that the effective topos did indeed contain a small complete category. When, led by Moggi\u2019s suggestion, I first came to consider the matter, I realized that the \u2018result\u2019 was staring me in the face. It is just a matter of putting together some well-known facts. The effective topos is the world of realizability (Kleene [15]) extended from arithmetic to general constructive mathematics. Details are in [ll], and the general context in [12] and [21]. The relevant subcategory, called the category of effective objects in [ll], is already in Kreisel [16].

The logical framework, LF, is an example of such a dependent-type \u03bb-calculus. A small subset of intuitionistic logic with quantification over simply typed \u03bb-calculus has also been proposed as a framework for specifying general logics. The logic of hereditary Harrop formulas with quantification at all non-predicate types, denoted here as hh\u03c9, is such a meta-logic that has been implemented in both the Isabelle theorem prover and the \u03bbProlog logic programming language. Both frameworks provide for specifications of logics in which details involved with free and bound variable occurrences, substitutions, eigenvariables, and the scope of assumptions within object logics are handled correctly and elegantly at the \u201cmeta\u201d level. In this paper, we show how LF can be encoded into hh\u03c9 in a direct and natural way by mapping the typing judgments in LF into propositions in the logic of hh\u03c9. This translation establishes a very strong connection between these two languages: the order of quantification in an LF signature is exactly the order of a set of hh\u03c9 clauses, and the proofs in one system correspond directly to proofs in the other system. Relating these two languages makes it possible to provide implementations of proof checkers and theorem provers for logics specified in LF by using standard logic programming techniques which can be used to implement hh\u03c9.", "year": "1990", "authors": ["Amy P.

A non-deterministic translation algorithm between expansion proofs andH-deductions is presented and its correctness is proven. We also present an algorithm for translation in the other direction and prove its correctness. A cut-elimination algorithm for expansion proofs is given and its partial correctness is proven. Strong termination of this algorithm remains a conjecture for the full higher-order system, but is proven for the first-order fragment. We extend the translations to a non-analytic proof system which contains a primitive notion of equality, while leaving the notion of expansion proof unaltered. This is possible, since a non-extensional equality is definable in our system of type theory. Next we extend analytic and non-analytic proof systems and the translations between them to include extensionality. Finally, we show how the methods and notions used so far apply to the problem of translating expansion proofs into natural deductions. Much care is taken to specify this translation in a modular way (through tactics) which leaves a large number of choices and therefore a lot of room for heuristics to produce elegant natural deductions.

The approach is illustrated by an extension of the language Fun of L. Cardelli and P. Wegner (1985), which is interpreted via a translation into an extended polymorphic lambda calculus. The approach interprets inheritances in Fun as coercion functions already definable in the target of the translation. Existing techniques in the theory of semantic domains can then be used to interpret the extended polymorphic lambda calculus, thus providing many models for the original language. The method allows the simultaneous modeling of parametric polymorphism, recursive types, and inheritance, which has been regarded as problematic because of the seemingly contradictory characteristics of inheritance and type recursion on higher types. The main difficulty in providing interpretations for explicit type disciplines featuring inheritance is identified. Since interpretations follow the type-checking derivations, coherence theorems are required, and the authors prove them for their semantic method.<<ETX>>", "year": "1989", "authors": ["Val Tannen", "Thierry Coquand", "Carl A.

We develop a \u03bb-calculus-based model for type systems that allows us to explore these interactions in a simple setting, unencumbered by complexities of production programming languages.\nThe evolution of languages from untyped universes to monomorphic and then polymorphic type systems is reviewed. Mechanisms for polymorphism such as overloading, coercion, subtyping, and parameterization are examined. A unifying framework for polymorphic type systems is developed in terms of the typed \u03bb-calculus augmented to include binding of types by quantification as well as binding of values by abstraction.\nThe typed \u03bb-calculus is augmented by universal quantification to model generic functions with type parameters, existential quantification and packaging (information hiding) to model abstract data types, and bounded quantification to model subtypes and type inheritance. In this way we obtain a simple and precise characterization of a powerful type system that includes abstract data types, parametric polymorphism, and multiple inheritance in a single consistent framework. The mechanisms for type checking for the augmented \u03bb-calculus are discussed.\nThe augmented typed \u03bb-calculus is used as a programming language for a variety of illustrative examples. We christen this language Fun because fun instead of \u03bb is the functional abstraction keyword and because it is pleasant to deal with.\nFun is mathematically simple and can serve as a basis for the design and implementation of real programming languages with type facilities that are more powerful and expressive than those of existing programming languages. In particular, it provides a basis for the design of strongly typed object-oriented languages.", "year": "1985", "authors": ["Luca Cardelli", "Peter Wegner"], "refs": []},

The semantics of Quest is rather challenging. In particular, difficulties arise when we try to model simultaneously features such as contravariant function spaces, record types, subtyping, recursive types, and fixpoints. In this paper we describe in detail the type inference rules for Quest, and we give them meaning using a partial equivalence relation model of types. Subtyping is interpreted as in previous work by Bruce and Longo, but the interpretation of some aspects, namely subsumption, power kinds, and record subtyping, is novel. The latter is based on a new encoding of record types. We concentrate on modeling quantifiers and subtyping; recursion is the subject of current work.

Such trees contains substitution formulas and selected (critical) variables at various non-term/hal nodes. These trees encode a shallow formula and a deep formula \u2014 the latter containing the formulas which label the terminal nodes of the expansion tree. If a certain relation among the selected variables of an expansion tree is acycllc and if the deep formula of the tree is tantologous, then we say that the expansion tree is a special kind of proof, called an ET-proof, of its shallow formula. Because ET-proofs are suf~ciently simple and general (expansion trees are, in a sense, generalized formulas), they can be used in the context of not only first-order logic but also a version of higher-order logic which properly contains first-order logic. Since the computational logic literature has seldomly dealt with the nature of proofs in higher-order logic, our investigation of ET-proofs will be done entirely in this setting. It can be shown that a formula has an ET-proof if and only if that formula is a theorem of higher-order logic. Expanslon trees have several pleasing practical and theoretical properties. To demonstrate this fact, we use ET-proofs to extend and complete Andrews\u2019 procedure [4] for automatically constructing natural deductions proofs. We shall also show how to use a mating for an ET-proof\u2019s tautologous, deep formula to provide this procedure with the \u201clook ahead\u201d needed to determine if certain lines are unnecessary to prove other lines and when and how backchalning can be done. The resulting natural deduction proofs are generally much shorter and more readable than proofs build without using this mating information. This conversion process works without needing any search.

Up to equivalence, one may assume that each topos is equipped with a canonical choice of representative subobjects satisfying certain obvious conditions, and one insists that morphisms between toposes preserve these exactly. Between the category of small categories and that of toposes one inserts the category of \u201cdogmas\u201d (Volger's closed logical categories). Dog is known to be equational over Cat, and it is here shown to be a reflective subcategory of Top. A dogma is a category with canonical finite products, it has a Heyting algebra object \u03a9 which admits arbitrary objects as exponents such that, for each object A, the canonical morphism \u03a9 \u2192 \u03a9A has a left adjoint \u2203A and a right adjoint \u2200A, and it satisfies the usual axiom of extensionality (interpreted in the obvious way). The construction of the topos generated by a dogma follows Volger: its objects are \u201csets\u201d 1 \u2192 \u03a9A and its morphisms are \u201crelations\u201d between sets which are universally defined and single valued.

Usually modularity constructs also support some form of information hiding, such as \"abstract data types.\" \"Programming in the large\" is concerned with using such constructs to impose structure on large programs, in contrast to \"programming in the small\", which deals with the detailed implementation of algorithms in terms of data structures and control constructs.

The book familiarizes readers with categorical concepts through examples based on elementary mathematical notions such as monoids, groups and toplogical spaces, as well as elementary notions from programming-language semantics such as partial orders and categories of domains in denotational semantics.

I am indebted to Dr. Enrico Pagello of that laboratory for the opportunity of so doing. The audience was made up by philosophers, mathematicians and computer scientists. Accordingly, I tried to say something which might be of interest to each of these three categories. Essentially the same lectures, albeit in a somewhat improved and more advanced form, were given later in the same year as part of the meeting on Konstruktive Mengenlehre und Typentheorie which was organized in Munich by Prof. Dr. Helmut Schwichtenberg, to whom I am indebted for the invitation, during the week 29 September \u2013 3 October 1980. The main improvement of the Munich lectures, as compared with those given in Padova, was the adoption of a systematic higher level (Ger. Stufe) notation which allows me to write simply respectively. Moreover, the use of higher level variables and constants makes it possible to formulate the elimination and equality rules for the cartesian product in such a way that they follow the same pattern as the elimination and equality rules for all the other type forming operations. In their new formulation, these rules read \u03a0-elimination c \u2208 \u03a0(A, B) (y(x) \u2208 B(x) (x \u2208 A)) d(y) \u2208 C(\u03bb(y)) F(c, d) \u2208 C(c) and \u03a0-equality (x \u2208 A) b(x) \u2208 B(x) (y(x) \u2208 B(x) (x \u2208 A)) d(y) \u2208 C(\u03bb(y)) F(\u03bb(b), d) = d(b) \u2208 C(\u03bb(b)) respectively. Here y is a bound function variable, F is a new non-canonical (eliminatory) operator by means of which the binary application operation can be defined, putting Ap(c, a) \u2261 F(c, (y) y(a)), and y(x) \u2208 B(x) (x \u2208 A) is an assumption, itself hypothetical, which has been put within parentheses to indicate that it is being discharged. A program of the new form F(c, d) has value e provided c has value \u03bb(b) and d(b) has value e. This rule for evaluating F(c, d) reduces to the lazy evaluation rule for Ap(c, a) when the above definition is being made.

It provides an overview on a completion algorithm for hierarchical conditional term rewriting systems (CTRS). The algorithm starts by trying to orient as many equations as it can, using information given by the user about the precedence on the operators. When it has too little information, it asks the user for more. Moreover, it checks the rules against hierarchy hypotheses. The preconditions have to be primitive and the left-hand sides have to contain at least one nonprimitive operator. Then, the algorithm computes critical pairs and tries to prove that they are convergent on ground terms. First order theorem proving techniques are considered as definitely necessary to deal with the preconditions when one restrict the class of models to Log-models. To apply the obtained results to proofs in parameterized a specification, which implies carefully studying the properties in this domain.

Our correctness proofs are comparatively simple and apply to a large class of specific versions of completion. The notion of critical pair criterion can also be conveniently formalized in our framework. \nWe further discuss completion for rewriting modulo a congruence and present methods that are more general in scope than other completion procedures. We present, for instance, a completion procedure that can be applied to equational theories with infinite congruence classes; a case that can not be handled by any other method. \nWe also describe an extension of standard completion, completion without failure, that often succeeds in constructing a canonical system when standard completion fails.

The technique used to prove this theorem was the Knuth-Bendix completion method with associative and/or commutative unification. This was applied to a set of reductions consisting of a complete set of reductions for free rings plus the reduction x \u00d7 x \u00d7 x \u2192 and resulted in the purely forward-reasoning derivation of x \u00d7 y = y \u00d7 x. An important extension to this methodology, which made solution of the x 3 = x ring problem feasible, is the use of cancellation laws to simplify derived reductions. Their use in the Knuth-Bendix method can substantially accelerate convergence of complete sets of reductions. A second application of the Knuth-Bendix method to the set of reductions for free rings plus the reduction x \u00d7 x \u00d7 x \u2192 x, but this time with the commutativity of multiplication assumed, resulted in the discovery of a complete set of reductions for free rings satisfying x 3 = x. This complete set of reductions can be used to decide the word problem for the x 3 = x ring.", "year": "1984", "authors": ["Mark E. Stickel"], "refs": []},

Reasoning about equations may involve deciding if an equation follows from a given set of equations (axioms), or if an equation is true in a given theory. When used in this manner, equations state properties that hold between objects. Equations may also be used as definitions; this use is well known in computer science: programs written in applicative languages, abstract interpreter definitions, and algebraic data type definitions are clearly of this nature. When these equations are regarded as oriented \"rewrite rules,\" we may actually use them to compute. In addition to covering these topics, we discuss the problem of \"solving\" equations (the \"unification\" problem), the problem of proving termination of sets of rewrite rules, and the decidability and complexity of word problems and of combinations of equational theories.

Several of the formal specifications and verifications performed in support of RCP and AAMP5 are individually of considerable complexity and difficulty.

Processes maintain these logical clocks by computing periodic adju#tments to their hardware clocks. Although the underlying hardware clocks have a bounded rate of drift from real time, the drift of logical clocks can exceed this bound. In other words, synchronized logical clocks can have a lower accuracy (with respect to real time) than that specified for hardware clocks. This reduction in accuracy might appear to be an inherent consequence of synchronization. The rate of drift of faulty hardware clocks can be beyond the specified bounds, and correct logical clocks can be forced to drift with them. Furthermore, variation in message delivery times introduces uncertainty in evaluating values of clocks of other processes.

The Edinburgh PROLOG system is in particular a superb piece of software engineering which allows the logic progammer to compile assertions into DEC-10 machine code and thus run logic programs with an efficiency which compares favourably with that of compiled LISP. All other implementations of logic programming (including our own, which we describe in this paper) are based on interpreters. However, PROLOG is not, and does not claim to be, the definitive logic programming formalism. It has features which (however useful in practical applications) are somewhat foreign to Kowalski's original simple and clear conception of a deductive, assertional programming language based entirely on the LUSH resolution of Horn clauses. In this conception there are no imperative constructs and indeed there is no notion of control or of anything 'happening'. The spirit is very like that of Strachey's static Platonic vision \u2014 elaborated by Landin and later by Scott \u2014 of programs as purely denotative expressions in which entities are represented as the results of applicative combinations of functions with their arguments. Running a program is, on this view, nothing more than finding out what it denotes. The program merely does the denoting, and should not be taken for a prescription of any sort of activity, such as 'computing'.", "year": "2013", "authors": ["John Alan Robinson", "Edwin L.

It extends recent work in game semantics, in which programs are interpreted as strategies for computation by interaction with an environment. Abramsky has suggested that an intensional hierarchy of computational features such as state, and their fully abstract models, can be captured as violations of the constraints on strategies in the basic functional model. Non-local control flow is shown to fit into this framework as the violation of strong and weak \u2018bracketing\u2019 conditions, related to linear behaviour. The language PCF (Parigot\u2019s with constants and recursion) is adopted as a simple basis for higher-type, sequential computation with access to the flow of control. A simple operational semantics for both call-by-name and call-by-value evaluation is described. It is shown that dropping the bracketing condition on games models of PCF yields fully abstract models of PCF. The games models of PCF are instances of a general construction based on a continuations monad on Fam(C), where C is a rational cartesian closed category with infinite products. Computational adequacy, definability and full abstraction can then be captured by simple axioms on C. The fully abstract and universal models of PCF are shown to have an effective presentation in the category of Berry-Curien sequential algorithms. There is further analysis of observational equivalence, in the form of a context lemma, and a characterization of the unique functor from the (initial) games model, which is an isomorphism on its (fully abstract) quotient. This establishes decidability of observational equivalence for finitary PCF, contrasting with the undecidability of the analogous relation in pure PCF.", "year": "1999", "authors": ["James David Laird"], "refs": ["https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Continuation-models-are-universal-for-Hofmann-Streicher/c4df5f7f8b9eac40105c9438702fb5d1c29e6b62", "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/On-full-abstraction-for-PCF-Hyland-Ong/bd078c916ddc130f68ac9972ad0fafcf606fb857", "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/A-semantic-view-of-classical-proofs%3A-categorical%2C-Ong/721ae1ba356a78a173070b40b96839d65a1816fc", "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Computational-lambda-calculus-and-monads-Moggi/f67dec0099505e23e9441a9a567fea1d97ff69f6", "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/The-%7C-lambda-Calculus.-Hodes-Barendregt/a9d20a256b0073b17ef46a95df48adceb86744e3", "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Logical-Full-Abstraction-and-PCF-Longley-Plotkin/75a1cc55ea1bdb0a8c581f8231ee89d5b4b0e106", "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/A-fully-abstract-game-semantics-for-general-Abramsky-Honda/bfb73b62c6e1d72a4ccdcf2bbb854f6d71dc4d9b", "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Control-categories-and-duality%3A-an-axiomatic-to-the-Selinger/590eddd78a11821a5a6d8f39cb10d27ff356554a", "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Games-and-Full-Abstraction-for-a-Functional-with-McCusker/ccd494e0ec14561d24e1a8afd981774c8225625d", "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/A-Curry-Howard-foundation-for-functional-with-Ong-Stewart/5571aa96a9f5c9520b4847b2393f1e9c9c3c5936"]},

On the other hand, with this strategy, the argument of a function is re-evaluated at each time it is used.To avoid this drawback, we define the notion of \u201cstorage operator\u201d, for each data type. IfT is a storage operator for integers, for example, let us replace the evaluation, by leftmost reduction, of\u03d5\u03c4 (where\u03c4 is an integer, and\u03d5 any\u03bb-term) by the evaluation oft\u03c4\u03d5. Then, this computation is the same as the following: first compute\u03c4 up to some reduced form\u03c40, and then apply\u03d5 to\u03c40. So, we have simulated \u201ccall-by-value\u201d evaluation within the strategy of leftmost reduction.The main theorem of the paper (Corollary of Theorem 4.1) shows that, in a second order\u03bb-calculus, using G\u00f6del's translation of classical intuitionistic logic, we can find a very simple type (or specification) for storage operators. Thus, it gives a way to get such operators, which is to prove this type in second order intuitionistic predicate calculus.R\u00e9sum\u00e9En\u03bb-calcul, la strat\u00e9gie de r\u00e9duction \u00e0 gauche (appel par nom) a, comme on sait, de bonnes propri\u00e9t\u00e9s math\u00e9matiques; en particulier, elle termine toujours si on l'applique \u00e0 un terme normalisable. Mais, avec cette strat\u00e9gie, l'argument d'une fonction est recalcul\u00e9 \u00e0 chaque utilisation.Pour \u00e9viter ce d\u00e9faut, on d\u00e9finit la notion \u00abd'op\u00e9rateur de mise en m\u00e9moire\u00bb (pour un type de donn\u00e9es). SiT est un op\u00e9rateur de mise en m\u00e9moire, pour les entiers par exemple, on remplace l'\u00e9valuation, par r\u00e9duction gauche, de \u03d5\u03c4 (o\u00f9 \u03c4 est un entier et \u03d5 un \u03bb-terme quelconque) par celle deT\u03c4\u03d5; et celle-ci revient \u00e0 ramener d'abord \u03c4 \u00e0 une forme r\u00e9duite \u03c40, puis \u00e0 appliquer \u03d5 \u00e0 \u03c40.

This is indicated by the fact that in linear logic, two assumptions of a formula A are distinguished from a single assumption of A.

Hardware and software engineers apply the theory routinely. Yet from a foundational standpoint, there are aspects of classical logic that are problematic. Unlike intuitionistic logic, classical logic is often held to be non-constructive, and so, is said to admit no proof semantics. To draw an analogy in the proofs-as-programs paradigm, it is as if we understand well the theory of manipulation between equivalent specifications (which we do), but have comparatively little foundational insight of the process of transforming one program to another that implements the same specification. This extended abstract outlines a semantic theory of classical proofs based on a variant of Parigot's /spl lambda//spl mu/-calculus, but presented here as a type theory. After reviewing the conceptual problems in the area and the potential benefits of such a theory, we sketch the key steps of our approach in terms of the questions that we have sought to answer: Syntax: How should one circumscribe a coherent system of classical proofs? Is there a satisfactory Curry-Howard style representation theory? Categorical characterization: What is the \"boolean algebra\" of classical propositional proofs (as opposed to validity)?

Lorenzen suggested that the (constructive) meaning of a proposition \u03d5 should be specified by telling how to conduct a debate between a proponent P who asserts \u03d5 and an opponent O who denies \u03d5. Thus propositions are interpreted as games, connectives (almost) as operations on games, and validity as existence of a winning strategy for P. (The qualifier \u2018almost\u2019 will be discussed later when more details have been presented.) We propose that the connectives of linear logic can be naturally interpreted as the operations on games introduced for entirely different purposes by Blass (1972). We show that affine logic, i.e., linear logic plus the rule of weakening, is sound for this interpretation. We also obtain a completeness theorem for the additive fragment of affine logic, but we show that completeness fails for the multiplicative fragment. On the other hand, for the multiplicative fragment, we obtain a simple characterization of game-semantical validity in terms of classical tautologies. An analysis of the failure of completeness for the multiplicative fragment leads to the conclusion that the game interpretation of the connective \u2297 is weaker than the interpretation implicit in Girard's proof rules; we discuss the differences between the two interpretations and their relative advantages and disadvantages.

The completion procedure transforms a finite presentation into a uniformly terminating equivalence class term rewriting system which is Church-Rosser (terminates uniquely) and therefore decides equivalence of words 7in the given finitely presented commutative semigroup. Words are expressed in multiplicative exponential form, i.e. as finite vectors, so that fixed uniformly terminating Church-Rosser equivalence class term rewriting systems decide equivalence of words in constant space. Since the uniform word problem for finitely presented commutative semigroups requires exponential space on infinitely many instances, a Church-Rosser term rewriting system must be exponentially larger than its presentation for infinitely many presentations.

The intuitionistic truth definition is that of Kleene(1). He has arithmetized this truth notion in the definition of a syntactical predicate \"the natural number a realizes the number-theoretic formula A\" [15, \u00a75]. A familiarity wi', a this definition as well as other portions of Kleene's paper will be presupposed for the following. The present results relate the constructibility demands of the intuitionists as embodied in a formal system of number theory by Heyting to Church's thesis identifying constructible and general recursive functions [8; 9; 3]. In Part I, it is shown that certain systems of intuitionistic number theory satisfy the definition for realizability. We demonstrate that any formula deductible from a realizable formula in one of these formal systems is realizable. This result enables us, by the reasoning of Kleene [15, \u00a710 ], to show that certain classically true formulas are not provable in intuitionistic number theory. Likewise, it affords a demonstration that certain classically true formulas of the predicate calculus are unprovable in the intuitionistic predicate calculus. Then, following Kleene's notation [15, \u00a7\u00a711-12], we demonstrate that the formulas AZ)\u00aeA and \u00aeA3A are realizable. This result concerns an interpretative consistency proof for a system of intuitionistic number theory which is an extension of the usual formalization [15, \u00a713]. Parts II and III take up the problem of formalizing a portion of the theory of recursive functions and predicates in intuitionistic number theories. Part II is concerned principally with the formalization of material which is familiar on the intuitive plane and much of which has already been formalized in the framework of a classical logic. We utilize the work of Hubert and Bernays [10, vol. l] and G\u00f6del [\u00f3] to avoid additional laborious detail. Part III introduces formulas Kk(e, ai, \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 , ak, b) representing primitive recursive predicates having properties similar to Kleene's predicates Tk(e, ax, \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 , ak, b) [13, \u00a7\u00a74, 7], but defined in a way which facilitates formalization of the theory of general and partial recursive functions and predicates.

Some of the many simplifiers that can be built in are axioms for (left and right) identities, inverses, and multiplication by zero.\nAs for results, commutativity is built in by a straightforward modification to the unification (matching) algorithm.

The framework significantly refines and extends the scope of the concurrent constraint programming paradigm [Sar89] in two fundamental ways: (1) by allowing for the consumption of information by agents it permits a direct modelling of (indeterminate) state change in a logical framework, and (2) by admitting simply-typed -terms as dataobjects, it permits the construction, transmission and application of (abstractions of) programs at run-time. Much more dramatically, however, the framework can be seen as presenting higher-order (and if desired, constraint-enriched) versions of a variety of other asynchronous concurrent systems, including the asynchronous (\u2018\u2018input guarded\u201d) fragment of the (first-order) -calculus, Hewitt\u2019s actors formalism, (abstract forms of) Gelernter\u2019s Linda, asynchronous assignment-based languages, and Petri nets.

Pretopology is obtained from formal topology by isolating and disregarding those conditions which correspond to the structural rules of weakening and contraction. Pretopologies are the weakest possible structures in which an operation corresponding to implication is definable. They generally provide a sound and complete semantics for a ground logic, commonly called minimal linear. The completeness of intuitionistic logics, with or without either structural rule, is considered an easy corollary. It is noted that by restricting to pretopologies in which every open, or saturated, subset is regular, one obtains exactly Girard's phase semantics, and hence completeness for the classical system, and also an extension to the linear case of the usual double negation interpretation.

The significance of CSP is in the elegance by which a few simply stated constructs (e.g., sequential and parallel composition, nondeterministic choice, concealment, and recursion) lead to a language capable of expressing the full complexity of distributed computing. The difficulty in achieving satisfactory semantic models containing these constructs has been in providing an adequate treatment of nondeterminism, deadlock, and divergence. Fortunately, as a result of an evolutionay development in [S], [lo], [15], [l], [14], [2], and [4] we now have several such models. The purpose of this paper is to report the development of the first real-time models of CSP to be compatible with the properties and proof systems of the abovementioned untimed models. Our objective in this development is the construction of a timed CSP model which satisfies the following: (1) Continuous with respect to time. The time domain should consist of all nonnegative real numbers, and there should be no lower bound on the time difference between consecutive observable events from two processes operating asynchronously in parallel. (2) Realistic. A given process should engage in only finitely many events in a bounded period of time. (3) Continuous and distributive with respect to semantic operators. All semantic operators should be continuous, and all the basic operators as defined in [2], except recursion, should distribute over nondeterministic choice. (4) Verijiable design.

This is motivated by a mismatch between the \"standard\" (i.e., sensible) theory of the classical \u03bb-calculus and the practice of lazy functional programming. Part I sets up the fundamentals of the lazy \u03bb-calculus starting from the pure lazy language \u03bbl. We develop the rudiments of weakly sensible \u03bb-theory and characterize \u03bbl as the maximal such theory. The axiomatic framework of our theory is based on the notion of applicative transition systems which gives rise to lazy \u03bb-models. The subclass of lazy \u03bb-models which are operationally extensional are called lambda transition systems (lts\u2032s). The canonical model of the lazy \u03bb-calculus is the initial solution to the domain equation D \u2245 [D \u2192 D]\u22a5. We set up the domain logic corresponding to the same type expression. In part II, we recast the full abstraction problem in the lazy \u03bb-calculus. The pure lazy language \u03bbl is not equationally fully abstract w.r.t. D. In fact, \u03bbl, \u03bbl\u03c9, (a labelled version of \u03bbl), and \u03bblc (\u03bbl augmented with a convergence testing constant) are all not equationally fully abstract w.r.t. D. We illustrate two approaches to full abstraction: \n\u2022 \nThe expansive approach consists in enriching the language by augmenting it with appropriate constants, thereby enabling all finite semantic information to be represented syntactically as program phrases using the machinery of domain logic developed in Part I. We show that \u03bb, which is \u03bb augmented with a parallel convergence testing constant, is conditionally fully abstract . \n \n\u2022 \nThe restrictive approach regards the language as prescribed and tailors the model to fit by \"cutting down\" (i.e., \"quotienting out\" by a bisimulation logical relation) the existing \"over-generous\" canonical model to an appropriate substructure. We establish a general method to construct inequationally fully abstract lazy \u03bb-models which are retracts of for a class of sufficiently expressive lts\u2032s in which the -projection maps are internally definable. \n \n \nThe restrictive approach solves the abstraction problem for \u03bblc and \u03bbl\u03c9 but not \u03bbl. The full abstraction problem for \u03bbl is reduced to a conjecture of the conservativity of \u03bbl\u03c9 over \u03bbl.

This approach serves as a uniform framework for generating and relating a series of increasingly sophisticated denotational models for Communicating Processes.These models differ in the underlying structure of their observations which influences both the number of representable language operators and the induced notion of process correctness. Safety properties are treated by all models; the more sophisticated models also permit proofs of certain liveness properties. An important feature of the models is a special hiding operator which abstracts from internal process activity. This allows large processes to be composed hierarchically from networks of smaller ones in such a way that proofs of the whole are constructed from proofs of its components.

We concentrate on Abramsky\u2032s lazy \u03bb- calculus and we follow two directions. Firstly, the \u03bb-calculus is studied within a process calculus by examining the equivalence [formula] induced by Milner\u2032s encoding into the \u03c0-calculus. We start from a characterization of [formula] presented in (Sangiorgi D., 1992) Ph.D. thesis. We derive a few simpler operational characterisations, from which we prove full abstraction w.r.t. Levy-Longo Trees. Secondly, we examine Abramsky\u2032s applicative bisimulation when the \u03bb-calculus is augmented with (well-formed) operators, that is symbols equipped with reduction rules describing their behaviour. In this way, the maximal discrimination between pure \u03bb-terms (i.e., the finest behavioural equivalence) is obtained when all operators are used. We prove that the presence of certain non-deterministic operators is sufficient and necessary to induce it and that it coincides with the discrimination given by [formula]. We conclude that the introduction of non-determinism into the \u03bb-calculus is exactly what makes applicative bisimulation appropriate for reasoning about the functional terms when concurrent features are also present in the language, or when they are embedded into a concurrent language.", "year": "1994", "authors": ["Davide Sangiorgi"], "refs": ["https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Functions-as-Processes-Milner/95dfb2ee3223cd842f4d5856b8d5137b77d8e2b6", "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Domain-Theory-and-the-Logic-of-Observable-Abramsky/0709d4fb7432b656873c6686b94cd266804c0165", "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Full-Abstraction-in-the-Lazy-Lambda-Calculus-Abramsky-Ong/6dc42b0a704ac7efc72231147614d71a919fbcd1", "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/The-Lazy-Lambda-Calculus-%3A-an-investigation-into-of-Ong/ad36b5d8f69c3caf89fe27b5bb23fdbe6dfa96c9", "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Set-theoretical-models-of-%CE%BB-calculus%3A-theories%2C-Longo/8c238318d2da9a06008edba06787fee23f43bc83", "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/A-lambda-calculus-for-parallel-functions-Boudol/550ff29c63d723928d32dfdc84693f5db46748bb"]},

The statement of the proof principles is independent of any of the various methods available for explicit construction of recursive predomains. Following Milner and Tofte (1991), the method of proof is called co-induction.

Inspiring from CCS, an alternative syntax is proposed for processes, bringing forward n-ary guarding operators. Given p and q in that syntax, which allows invisible actions to be expressed, p and q are said equivalent iff after any common experiment, they both react by identical answers or absence of answer to any ambiguous communication offer that the observer may present. It is shown that this equivalence is also a congruence ; a finite set of equational axioms is given for the congruence, which we prove to be a complete proof system by argumenting over canonical forms of programs.

The user may freely define his own data types, without the need to devise a complicated encoding in terms of low-level types. The language is very strongly typed, and as implemented it incorporates a typechecker which handles polymorphic types and overloaded operators. Functions are defined by a set of recursion equations; the left-hand side of each equation includes a pattern used to determine which equation to use for a given argument. The availability of arbitrary higher-order types allows functions to be defined which 'package' recursion. Lazily-evaluated lists are provided, allowing the use of infinite lists which could be used to provide interactive input/output and concurrency.

Retention of many members of each such set of inferences has seriously impeded the effectiveness of automatic theorem proving.

These categories form the basis for a novel abstract formulation of recursion theory, to which the present paper is devoted. The abstractness has of course its usual concomitant advantage of generality: it is interesting to see that many of the fundamental results of recursion theory remain valid in contexts far removed from their classic manifestations. A principal reason for introducing this new formulation is to achieve an algebraization of the generalized incompleteness theorem, by providing a category-theoretic development of the concepts and tools of elementary recursion theory that are inherent in demonstrating the theorem. Dominical recursion theory avoids the commitment to sets and partial functions which is characteristic of other formulations, and thus allows for an intrinsic recursion theory within such structures as polyadic algebras. It is worthy of notice that much of elementary recursion theory can be developed without reference to elements . By Godel's generalized incompleteness theorem for consistent arithmetical system T we mean any statement of the following sort: (1) if every recursive set is definable in T , then T is essentially undecidable [41]; or (2) if all recursive functions are definable in T , then T is essentially undecidable [41]; or (3) if every recursive set is definable in T , then T 0 and R 0 (the sets of Godel numbers of the theorems and refutables of T ) are recursively inseparable [39]; or (4) if all re sets are representable in T , then T 0 is creative [28], [39]; or (5) if T is a Rosser theory (i.e., all disjoint re sets are strongly separable in T ), then T 0 and R 0 are effectively inseparable [39].", "year": "1987", "authors": ["Robert A.

A working computer program, qa3, based on these ideas is described. The performance of the program compares favorably with several other general question-answering systems. 1. QUESTION ANSWERING A question-answering system accepts information about some subject areas and answers questions by utilizing this information. The type of question-answering system considered in this paper is ideally one having the following features: 1. A language general enough to describe any reasonable question-answering subjects and express desired questions and answers. 2. The ability to search efficiently the stored information and recognize items that are relevant to a particular query. 3. The ability to derive an answer that is not stored explicitly, but that is derivable by the use of moderate effort from the stored facts. 4. Interactions between subject areas; for example, if the system has facts about Subject a and Subject b, then it should be able to answer a question that requires the use of both sets of facts. 5. Capability of allowing the user to add new facts or replace old facts conveniently. This paper argues the case for formal methods to achieve such a system and presents one particular approach in detail. A natural language facility is not one of the properties sought after or discussed (although Coles, 1968, has added to the program described here a translator from a subset of English to first-order logic). The name \u2018question-answering system\u2019 requires clarification. The system described above might be named an \u2018advice taker\u2019 or a \u2018multi-purpose problem-solving system\u2019 or \u2018general problem-solving system\u2019. McCarthy (1958) proposed using formal languages and deduction to construct such a system, and suggested allowing the user to give hints or advice on how to answer a question; he referred to the proposed system as an \u2018advice taker\u2019. Research on \u2018multi-purpose\u2019 or \u2018general problem-solving\u2019 tends to differ from question-answering as described above by placing more emphasis on solving deeper, more difficult problems and less emphasis on user interaction, formality, and efficient retrieval of relevant facts from a large data base. The situation is further confused by the use of \u2018question-answering\u2019 to refer sometimes to natural language systems, sometimes to information retrieval systems having little deductive ability, and sometimes to systems with deductive ability limited to the propositional calculus.", "year": "2010", "authors": ["C.

The behavior of a program part, that is, its meaning, is defined to be its observation congruence class.\nThe paper demonstrates, for a sequence of simple languages expressing finite (terminating) behaviors, that in each case observation congruence can be axiomatized algebraically.

The foundations of a new \"categorical\" combinatory logic are laid down. Compilation and evaluation techniques are investigated. A simple abstract machine, called the Categorical Abstract Machine, is presented: it has served as the core of the implementation of the language CAML, of the ML family, developed at INRIA-Roquencourt and Ecole Normale Superieure, and first released in 1987. The main characteristics of this approach are conceptual simplicity and compactness, with bearings on portability, efficiency, and correctness proofs. A mathematical semantics of sequentiality is proposed, in which \"sequential algorithms\" rather than functions are used to interpret procedures. The theoretical investigation has led to the development of a programming language, CDSO, in which basic and functional types are not differentiated. The evaluation framework is a demand-driven data flow network.

The wide variety of techniques in modern languages, e.g., call-by-value, call-by-name, pass-by-reference, suggests a lack of consensus about the advantages and disadvantages of the various techniques. In this paper we analyze the most common techniques by studying and comparing equational theories for each of them. Plotkin [20] was the first to consider equational theories for the analysis of parameter-passing techniques. Starting from the folklore that Church\u2019s A-calculus captures the essence of call-by-name in a ~rmctionai language, he developed a variant of the calculus, the ~.-calculus, to formalize the notion of call-by-value in a simple framework comparable to the ~-calculus. More importantly, he used these two examples, callby-name and call-by-value, to analyze the formal relationship between programming languages and calculi. Both the ~-calculus and the Av-calculus satisfy general correspondence conditions with respect to the appropriate semantics: (1) the calculi are sufficiently strong to evaluate a program to its answer and (2) they are sound in the sense that the equality of terms in the calculus implies their interchangeability in all program contexts. Recently, Felleisen with Friedman [9] and Hieb [10] extended Plotkin\u2019s work to call-by-value programming languages with imperative constructs like assignments and jumps, Their result shows that, like functional constructs, imperative constructs have a simple rewriting semantics, and that there are conservative extensions of the Au-calculus for reasoning about them, namely the Av-{C,S,CS}-calculi. The extension of Plotkin\u2019s work to imperative languages is important because it enables us to consider the whole spectrum of conventional parameterpassing techniques. Specifically, it is only through the addition of imperative constructs that the design options for alternative parameter-passing techniques become interesting. Whereas in a functional setting the only observable differences between call-by-value and call-by-name versions of a program is the termination behavior, the two versions of the same program can produce different results in imperative languages. Moreover, in the presence of assignments, it is also possible to distinguish parameter-passing techniques that bind parameters to values from those that bind parameters to references to values. Based on these observations, we classify parameterpassing techniques according to their respective evaluation and binding strategies. The evaluation strategy determines when -10 evaluate procedure arguments, while the binding strategy determines what part of the argument to bind to formal parameters. The two prevailing evaluation strategies are eager evaluation (call-by-value), which evaluates the argument to a procedure call before binding the parameter, and delayed evaluation (call-by-name), which does not evaluate the argument until the value of the parameter is needed.1 As for binding strategies, we consider pass-byworth, which binds the parameter to the value, i.e., \u201cworth,\u201d of the argument, and pass-by-reference, which binds the parameter to a variable, i.e., a \u201creference\u201d to a value. A third strategy, pass-by-vaJueresuli, has properties of both pass-by-worth and passby-reference. In this paper, we analyze the parameter-passing techniques produced by the various combinations of evaluation and binding strategies. Also included is a discussion of the reference cell, a language construct that provides an alternative to the pass-by-reference binding technique. For each technique we develop a rewriting semantics and a calculus for a higher-order programming language that uses the technique. The calculi satisfy variants of Plotkin\u2019s correspondence criteria. In addition, their imperative fragments sat] Two other delayed evaluation strategies, which we do not consider in this paper, are call-by-text and call-by-need. Callby-text never evaluates procedure arguments, thus, delaying evaluation forever. Muller [17] recently analyzed some of the problems of deriving equational theories in the presence of callby-text. Call-by-need is an optimization of call-by-name in a functional language, but produces different answers than caUby-name in the presence of side-effects. The extended version of this paper [4] contains a brief discussion of call-by-need. isfy strong normalization theorems and are therefore decidable. The next section of this paper describes in more detail the steps of the analysis: the definition of an operational semantics, the derivation of an equational calculus, and the formal analysis of correspondence between the semantics and the calculus. Section 3 examines each of the parameter-passing techniques using the methods outlined in Section 2. We discuss related work and compare the different techniques in Sections 4 and 5. 2 From Operational Semantics to Calculi In our analysis of parameter-passing, there are three main steps. First, we define an operational semantics for a language with a particular parameter-passing technique. Next, we derive an equational calculus directly from the semantics, and finally, we analyze the correspondence between the calculus and the semantics. This section describes each of these steps in more detail. Definition of a Language and its Operational Semantics The definition of a language consists of two parts: the specification of a syntax and an operational semantics. We provide one for each of the parameterpassing techniques. The core of our languages, A, consists of const ants (c), variables (z), A-abstractions and applications of the A-calculus: e ::= 8 I v I (ee) v ::= c I Xr.e The languages extend A with constructs for sideeffects, which we describe in later sections. Following Barendregt\u2019s [1] conventions, we assume that, in the following definitions and theorems, the bound variables are distinct from the free variables in expressions, and we identify expressions that differ only by a renaming of the bound variables. The expression e [z +e\u2019] denotes the expression resulting from the substitution of all free occurrences of the variable ~ in e with the expression e\u2019. The set of free variables in an expression e is denoted by FV(e). An expression with no free variables is closed. Below we need the notion of a context for several definitions. A context, C, is a term with a \u201chole\u201d ([]) in the place of a subexpression; C[e] is the expression produced by replacing the hole in a context C with the expression e.", "year": "1991", "authors": ["Erik Crank", "Matthias Felleisen"], "refs": []},

Linear logic, introduced by Girard, has many advantages which are of use in studying coherence. Most notably, its resource-sensitive nature makes it ideal for studying monoidal closed structures. The logical approach is also modified by using natural deduction rather than sequent calculus. The natural deduction system in question is proof nets, also introduced by Girard. Proof nets have several important properties which are exploited to prove the coherence theorem. In particular, the cut elimination procedure is confluent and strongly normalizing. \n \nThe approach to coherence is to define a general structure, the autonomous deductive system, for defining many theories of monoidal closed categories. An autonomous deductive system is a deductive system with several added features, which are suggested by the properties of proof nets. It is then possible to give a straightforward criterion for whether a given theory of monoidal closed categories, specified by an autonomous deductive system, is coherent. \n \nFinally, a relationship is established between coherence and the composition problem for dinatural transformations.

The chapter analyzes the notion of definitional equality and its formal counterpart, convertibility, and advocates a change in the current definition of convertibility for systems in which explicit definitions are represented by means of lambda abstraction rather than the introduction of constants or the special constants called combinators. Because of the correspondence between lambda terms and natural deductions, this change is equally called for in Prawitz's definition of convertibility for natural deductions. The chapter also outlines that the transition to intuitionistic abstractions on the metalevel is essential and nontrivial; essential, because they are the most fruitful notion of model, the interpretation of the convertibility relation conv, is standard, that is, it is interpreted as definitional equality in the model, and definitional equality is a notion that is unmentionable within the classical set theoretic framework.", "year": "1975", "authors": ["Per Martin-L\u00f6uf"], "refs": []},

This idea, though not intended, gave rise to some confusion and separated those who believed in initial semantics from those who believed in final semantics. The fundamental criticism in the initial algebra approach was the following: the \"abstraction-function\" should map the representations to the abstract data type (which makes it final), and not the other way around. But it seems that this controversy was purely a misunderstanding (not by Wand himself), since the initial homomorphism from the initial algebra to the algebras of the specification is not intended to be the \"abstraction function\", nor its counter part, the \"representation function\". Instead it models the highly desirable property of initial algebras as realizing the specification in a certain \"minimal\" way, usually expressed by the principles \"no confusion\" and \"no junk\". The final algebra semantics of specifications better fits the intentions of algebraic implementations, and of \"behavioral abstraction\". The latter was introduced already in 1976 by Giarratana, Gimona, and Montanari (see /GGM 76/) and was motivated by the behavior notion of finite automata theory. Final algebra semantics of algebraic specification has been intensively studied by many authors (see /Kl 83/ for an overview) but is not equally unified and developed as initial algebra semantics. Beside the final algebra approach there are data type specification techniques which originate from the theory of recursive equations (see /Lo 81/, /Kl 83/, /BMSi 84/), and which are studied in view of the assertion calculus for program verification, or in respect to evaluation strategies and complexity. It was early discovered that simple algebraic specifications, which consist of listings of sort symbols, operation symbols, and equations, are in their pure f.orm not appropriate for writing down specifications of larger software systems. Roughly speaking, in this regard they correspond to assembly code and not to structured programs of high level languages. This observation gave rise to the development of the specification language CLEAR by Burstall and Goguen (see /BG 77/ and /BG 80/), which is the first specification language conceptually based on algebraic specifications and their semantics. Among others, a concept of parameterized specifications is incorporated for an appropriate structuring of larger specifications and a modular design of software systems. This first algebraic specification language has considerably influenced the development of the theory of algebraic specifications and the design of other specification languages (see the bibliographic notes in the appendix of this volume).", "year": "1985", "authors": ["Hartmut Ehrig", "Bernd Mahr"], "refs": ["https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Structured-Algebraic-Specifications%3A-A-Kernel-Wirsing/43cf5847070285bd68d862c6f4637ebf1d4da20d", "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Passing-Compatibility-is-almost-Persistency-Orejas/2c50d6696ef29e0de188317e1ca344b6d4641ceb", "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Bibliography-on-Abstract-Data-Types-Kutzler-Lichtenberger/2e19316377e7583693f6e0f773a12c29948b1525", "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Correctness%2C-completeness%2C-and-consistency-of-data-Padawitz/c101404b0de701a4ec75fa5a8b51ee0d9025b502", "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Incremental-Construction-of-Unification-Algorithms-Jouannaud-Kirchner/10e82d4fef3dedb203f237f8492da4fe3cfac5cd"]},

Our combinatory logic is \"categorical\" because its combinators and rules are obtained by extracting untyped information from Cartesian closed categories (looking at arrows only, thus forgetting about objects). Compiling J.-calculus into these combinators happens to be natural and provokes only n log n code expansion. Moreover categorical com-binatory logic is entirely faithful to /~-reduction where combinatory logic needs additional rather complex and unnatural axioms to be. The connection easily extends to the corresponding typed calculi, where typed categorical combinatory logic is a free Cartesian closed category where the notion of terminal object is replaced by the explicit manipulation of applying (a function to its argument) and coupling (arguments to build datas in products).

For the past fifteen years, research on this problem has focused on developing a semantics for PCF, an idealized functional programming language based on the typed \u03bb-calculus. Unlike most practical languages, PCF has no facilities for observing and exploiting the evaluation order of arguments to procedures. Since we believe that these facilities play a crucial role in sequential computation, this paper focuses on a sequential extension of PCF, called SPCF, that includes two classes of control operators: a possibly empty set of error generators and a collection of catch and throw constructs. For each set of error generators, the paper presents a fully abstract semantics for SPCF. If the set of error generators is empty, the semantics interprets all procedures-including catch and throw-as Berry-Curien sequential algorithms . If the language contains error generators, procedures denote manifestly sequential functions. The manifestly sequential functions form a Scott domain that is isomorphic to a domain of decision trees, which is the natural extension of the Berry-Curien domain of sequential algorithms in the presence of errors.", "year": "1994", "authors": ["Robert Cartwright", "Pierre-Louis Curien", "Matthias Felleisen"], "refs": ["https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/On-the-Symmetry-of-Sequentiality-Curien/562ec7ba8b5afb035fe2844a42041aaa790e2e92", "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Studying-the-Fully-Abstract-Model-of-PCF-within-its-Jung-Stoughton/09c4e21f6a7b5c1ade1d4994fdb9d1371ad0bcb4", "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Observable-algorithms-on-concrete-data-structures-Curien/722f0754afec3b619e865f0a33003aa3478ae453", "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Observable-sequentiality-and-full-abstraction-Cartwright-Felleisen/f2199f745c701c3aba87052bd2a942d69a0360de", "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/SPCF%3A-Its-Model%2C-Calculus%2C-and-Computational-Power-Kanneganti-Cartwright/933dcfc21dcc0d22bb8a3a0ee106867652c6cf12", "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/The-Revised-Report-on-the-Syntactic-Theories-of-and-Felleisen-Hieb/2de3e6d85b2e7cb41a6e87b3188b9101d147dd82", "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Full-Abstraction-and-the-Context-Lemma-Jim-Meyer/502c3975eb38238e889cecf9c22af18c2b343143", "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Reasoning-with-continuations-II%3A-full-abstraction-Sitaram-Felleisen/b4d8b1a600ddab85d74c5642166d6240d20fbc2d"]},

It is a general-purpose communication system intended for constructing reliable distributed applications; it is a flexible framework for carrying out research in group ware protocols; it is a large-scale, system-style implementation built in a state-of-the-art programming language\\rc{lines of ML?}; and it is also a mathematical object designed to be amenable to formal analysis and manipulation. Thus, Ensemble straddles a number of disciplines of computer science ranging from systems architectures to formal methods. The principal advances described in this thesis are the creation of the Ensemble system and the demonstration that it exhibits the properties just mentioned. The thesis begins by presenting the Ensemble architecture, as well as background in group communication. We describe the various components of the architecture, give examples of their interactions, and compare this architecture with that of other layered communication systems. The Ensemble protocols make heavy use of layered micro-protocols. We describe optimization techniques that greatly reduce the performance overheads introduced by layering and show how the architecture facilitates these optimizations. In addition we show how to formalize these optimizations in type theory and implement them using the Nuprl theorem prover. Ensemble is implemented in a dialect of the ML programming language. We describe how the use of ML impacted the system, and present a wide range of comparisons between Ensemble and a similar system implemented in C.", "year": "1998", "authors": ["Mark Garland Hayden"], "refs": []},

The linear structure amounts to a-autonomous category: a closed symmetric monoidal category G with nite products and a closed involution. Girard's exponential operator, ! , is a cotriple on G which carries the canonical comonoid structure on A with respect to cartesian product to a comonoid structure on !A with respect to tensor product. This makes the Kleisli category for ! cartesian closed. 0. INTRODUCTION. In \\Linear logic\" 1987], Jean-Yves Girard introduced a logical system he described as \\a logic behind logic\". Linear logic was a consequence of his analysis of the structure of qualitative domains (Girard 1986]): he noticed that the interpretation of the usual conditional \\)\" could be decomposed into two more primitive notions, a linear conditional \\?\" and a unary operator \\!\" (called \\of course\"), which is formally rather like an interior operator: (1) The purpose of this note is to answer two questions (and perhaps pose some others.) First, if \\linear category\" means the structure making valid the proportion linear logic : linear category = typed-calculus : cartesian closed category then what is a linear category? This question is quite easy, and in true categorical spirit, one nds that it was answered long before being put, namely by Barr 1979]. Our intent here is mainly to supply a few details to make the matter more precise (though we leave many more details to the reader), to point out some similarities with work of Lambek 1987] (see these proceedings), and to appeal for a change in some of the notation of Girard 1987]. Second, what is the meaning of Girard's exponential operator ! ? Since Girard has in fact ooered several variants of ! in 1987], and another in Girard and Lafont 1987], one cannot be too dogmatic here, but some certainty as to the minimal demands ! makes is possible | in particular we show that ! ought to be a cotriple, and its Kleisli category ought to be cartesian closed, in order to capture the initial motivation of the exponential. Acknowledgement. This note should be regarded as a \\gloss\" on Girard 1987], providing the categorical context and terminology for that work; I think the categorical setting provides a genuine improvement, and in particular, indicates how the notation may be made clearer.

However, recently, more complicated constructions (such as power domains) have led to more general domains (Plotkin, 1976; Smyth and Plotkin, 1977; Smyth, 1983).

Specifically, it could be useful to have, in the stable case, a notion similar to the one of \u201cframe\u201d, in order to develop something similar to pointless topology, that is an algebraic insight of spaces. In domain theory, an interesting application of frame theory is the logic of domains developped by Abramsky (see [Ab]) in the topological case. The idea of constructing a logic for \u201cstable properties\u201d has been originated by Zhang (see [Zha]), who got very interesting results about \u201cstable opens\u201d of dI domains. However, his notions remain concrete, and it is not clear whether they give rise to a duality. In that sense, they lack the \u201clocalic\u201d properties which justify the canonicity of Abramsky\u2019s approach. We introduce the notion of S-Structure as the structure of the algebra of stable open sets intended to correspond to the concept of frame in the stable case. These S-structures have properties which are very similar to the ones of frames, from the point of view of duality. So we may hope to achieve a logic of domains as natural as Abramsky\u2019s one, but expressing properties of programs which are not captured by the continuous approach. In this paper, we give the fundamentals of S-structures theory. We prove first general duality results which do not involve any domain theoretical assumtion about spaces. Actually we introduce the S-spaces which play wrt S-structures the same role as topological spaces wrt frames. These duality results can be specialized to the case of domains, and then we obtain a result similar to known Scotttopological duality in domain theory. The corresponding notion of domain widely subsumes the usual dI domains to which stabilty theory is usually restricted. Indeed these domains are the most general ones where stability makes sense. By duality method it is rather simple to treat function spaces and we retrieve cartesian closedness of the category of L-domains and stable functions which has been recently proved by P.

Since we believe that such facilities are crucial for understanding the nature of sequential computation, this paper focuses on a sequential extension of PCF (called SPCF) that includes two classes of control operators: error generators enable us to construct a fully abstract model for SPCF that interprets higher types as sets of error-sensitive functions instead of continuous functions.

It presents Church's typed lambda calculus as an illustrative example. The chapter also presents a survey of typing features such as polymorphism, data abstraction, and automatic inference of type information. The main topics discussed in the study of typed lambda calculus are context-sensitive syntax and typing rules, a reduction system modeling program execution, an equational axiom system, and semantic models. Henkin models are used as the primary semantic framework with emphasis on three examples: set-theoretic, recursion-theoretic, and domain-theoretic hierarchies of functions. The chapter presents completeness theorems for arbitrary Henkin models and models without empty types, followed by an introduction to Cartesian closed categories and Kripke-style models. The technique of logical relations is used to prove a semantic completeness theorem and Church\u2013Rosser and strong normalization properties of reduction. Logical relations also encompass basic model-theoretic constructions such as quotients.", "year": "1990", "authors": ["John C.

Following initial algebra semantics, syntax is specified by manysorted signatures, and models are universal algebras whose carriers are complete partial orders and operations are continuous. The informal requirement that the meanings of iteration and recursion constructs be least fixed points of appropriate unary derived operations is formally expressed by least fixed point constraints. Full abstraction is treated as a relation between models and notions of program equivalence (congruences over the term algebra). A model is fully abstract with reference to an equivalence if it identifies exactly the equivalent terms. We give a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of fully abstract models of programming languages. This condition is used to show that fully abstract models do not exist for two nondeterministic imperative languages: one with random assignment and the other with infinite output streams. It is also used to develop a model-theoretic necessary and sufficient condition that is used to show the existence of fully abstract models of two other programming languages: a simple typed applicative language and an imperative language with explicit storage allocation and higher and recursive types.

In this paper we show that adding recursive types results in a non conservative extension of the system. This means that the algorithm for F\u2264 subtyping (the kernel of the algorithm for F\u2264 typing) is no longer complete for the extended system, even when it is applied only to judgements where no recursive type appears, and that most of the proofs of known properties of F\u2264 do not hold for the extended system; this is the case, for example, for Pierce's proof of undecidability of F\u2264.

The questionnaire, filled out via the Web by 4532 people across HP, showed that most participants (68%) had not taken part in a videoconference within the last 3 years, and only 3% of the sample were frequent users. Of those who had used videoconference systems, the main benefits were perceived to be the ability to: see people they had never met before, see facial expressions and gestures, and follow conversations with multiple participants more easily. The main problems that users of videoconference technology perceived were: the high overhead of setting up and planning videoconferencing meetings, a lack of a widespread base of users, the perception that videoconference technology did not add value over existing communication tools, and quality and reliability issues. Non-users indicated that the main barriers were lack of access to videoconference facilities and tools and a perception that they did not need to use this tool because other tools were satisfactory.

There is quite widespread agreement that it is one of the most difficult; there is much less agreement as to what exactly the problem is, or more particularly as to the precise criteria for a solution. The usual formulation is that one wants a \"semantic characterization\" of the fully abstract model (by which we mean the inequationally fully abstract order-extensional model, which Milner proved to be uniquely specified up to isomorphism by these properties [20]). The problem is to understand what should be meant by a \"semantic characterization\". Our view is that the essential content of the problem, what makes it important, is that it calls for a semantic characterization of sequential, functional computation at higher types. The phrase \"sequential functional computation\" deserves careful consideration. On the one hand, sequentiality refers to a computational process extended over time, not a mere function; on the other hand, we want to capture just those sequential computations in which the different parts or \"modules\" interact with each other in a purely functional fashion. There have, to our knowledge, been just four models of PCF put forward as embodying some semantic analysis. Three are domain-theoretic: the \"standard model\" based on Scott-continuous functions [23]; Berry's bidomains model based on stable functions [5]; and the Bucciarelli-Ehrhard model based on strongly stable functions [8]. The fourth is the Berry-Curien model based on sequential algorithms [6] (Cartwright and Felleisen's model turns out to be equivalent to the sequential algorithms model [9, 12]). Of these, we can say that the standard model gives a good account of functional computation at higher types, but fails to capture sequentiality, while the sequential algorithms model gives a good analysis of sequential computation, but fails to capture functional behaviour. In each case, the failure can calibrated in terms of definability: the standard model includes parallel functions; the sequential algorithms model includes algorithms which compute \"functionals\" which are sensitive to non-functional aspects of the behaviour of their arguments. The bidomains model also contains non-sequential functions; while the strongly stable model, in the light of a recent result by Ehrhard [14], can be seen as the \"extensional collapse\" of the", "year": "1994", "authors": ["Samson Abramsky"], "refs": ["https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Projecting-Sequential-Algorithms-on-Strongly-Stable-Ehrhard/968183bd76a9c61889c36e7a64b5a97523fea976", "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Lcf-considered-as-a-programming-language-Plotldn/bae0fca7b3bf7c19999c601b7acb21404e3c4bc5", "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Full-Abstraction-and-Semantic-Equivalence-Mulmuley/416d630301493f3b440c7a5c56b66fea1434014b", "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Fully-abstract-models-of-programming-languages-Stoughton/53d33b86347212656d93ab8eacfcc2aabd3f5a8d", "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Studying-the-Fully-Abstract-Model-of-PCF-within-its-Jung-Stoughton/09c4e21f6a7b5c1ade1d4994fdb9d1371ad0bcb4", "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Applications-of-Categories-in-Computer-Science%3A-and-Curien/f0b39e8e5ba0d84792bb1544ce9381d6a7f583e4", "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Observable-sequential-algorithms-on-concrete-data-Curien/92ebddd0c1a714d40f2dc33b240ec15ad4b24449", "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Observable-sequentiality-and-full-abstraction-Cartwright-Felleisen/f2199f745c701c3aba87052bd2a942d69a0360de", "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Proofs-as-Processes-Abramsky/838f4532ae4765d2cda50bf5994ff399d35a92b5"]},

The rst part of the thesis develops the theory of lazy and call-by-value languages separately, following paradigmatic studies of call-by-name functional languages. We rst describe the operational semantics of two simply-typed languages, lazy PCF and call-by-value PCF. These two languages provide enough intuition to describe general deenitions of denotational models and logics for lazy and call-by-value languages. We prove, via a completeness theorem, that the deenitions of models and logic coincide for both the lazy and call-by-value theories. The second part of the thesis compares the two kinds of languages via translations. Speciically, we develop the idea of a fully abstract translation and deene new fully abstract translations from call-by-value PCF to lazy PCF, and vice versa. We then use the ideas to develop an expressiveness theory for languages. The theory shows that call-by-value PCF and lazy PCF are equally expressive, and another language, call-by-name PCF, is strictly less expressive than either of the other two. iii iv v Acknowledgements I owe a great debt to my advisor, Albert R. Meyer. It was his initial question that set me working on logics and translations for the two languages in this thesis, and his technical help and encouragement along the way were invaluable. My only regret of the time I spent at MIT was not having more time to work on research with Albert. His enthusiasm, philosophical wisdom, and good taste have made a deep impression on me, and I hope, through his example, to develop these qualities in myself. It has also been a pleasure working with two other coauthors: Bard Bloom, once a student at MIT and now a faculty member at Cornell, and Stavros Cosmadakis of IBM Research. I learned a lot from Bard and Stavros, including facts not always connected to computer science! I would also like to thank the members of my thesis committee, David Giiord and Rishiyur Nikhil, who provided good comments on a draft of this thesis and during the defense, and Carl Gunter of the University of Pennsylvania, who gave me time to nish the thesis during the rst months of a postdoctoral position.

It is apparent that the \u2217-autonomous categories studied at length in [Barr, 1979] are a model for a large fragment of linear logic, although not quite for the whole thing. Since the main reference is out of print and since large parts of that volume are devoted to results highly peripheral to the matter at hand, it seemed reasonable to provide a short introduction to the subject. I include here the formal construction of my student Po-Hsiang Chu that appears as an appendix to that volume. At the time, the formal construction appeared not to have substantial mathematical interest, but it appears to be the most interesting part in the present context. It turns out, for example, that one can in many cases construct models of the full linear logic from Chu\u2019s construction applied to a cartesian closed category. One problem in this subject is that having two very different sources\u2014from linear logic as well as category theory\u2014two very different and essentially inconsistent notations have arisen. Without much hope, I will attempt here to introduce a terminology and notation that draws from both subjects and is as consistent as possible with the two different traditions. To begin with, there is the name \u2217-autonomous category that gives the \u2217 notation a privileged position. (It also gives librarians fits, which is a good reason to keep using it.) The notation using \u22a5 is certainly suggestive, but the name \u201cperp-autonomous\u201d categories is graceless. Thus I will continue to call them \u2217-autonomous categories for the time being. The notations 0, 1,+,\u00d7 for categorical initial object, final object, sum and product are too hallowed by use to even think of changing. Everyone agrees on \u2297 for the tensor. Then there is the dual construction, \u2217 In the preparation of this paper, I have been assisted by a grant from the NSERC of Canada.

The language of the theory is richer than the languages of traditional intuitionistic systems in permitting proofs to appear as parts of propositions so that the propositions of the theory can express properties of proofs. There are axioms for universes that link the generation of objects and types and play somewhat the same role for the present theory as does the replacement axiom for Zermelo\u2013Fraenkel set theory. The present theory is based on a strongly impredicative axiom that there is a type of all types in symbols. This axiom has to be abandoned, however, after it has been shown to lead to a contraction. This chapter discusses Normalization theorem, which can be strengthened in two ways: it can be made to cover open terms and it can be proved that every reduction sequence starting from an arbitrary term leads to a unique normal term after a finite number of steps. The definition of the notion of convertibility and the proof that an arbitrary term is convertible can no longer be separated because the type symbols and the terms are generated simultaneously.", "year": "1975", "authors": ["Per Martin-L\u00f6f"], "refs": []},

Unfortunately, programmers in functional languages such as Standard ML or Haskell do not have this luxury. Although some data structures designed for imperative languages such as C can be quite easily adapted to a functional setting, most cannot, usually because they depend in crucial ways on assignments, which are disallowed, or at least discouraged, in functional languages. To address this imbalance, we describe several techniques for designing functional data structures, and numerous original data structures based on these techniques, including multiple variations of lists, queues, double-ended queues, and heaps, many supporting more exotic features such as random access or efficient catenation. \nIn addition, we expose the fundamental role of lazy evaluation in amortized functional data structures. Traditional methods of amortization break down when old versions of a data structure, not just the most recent, are available for further processing. This property is known as persistence, and is taken for granted in functional languages. On the surface, persistence and amortization appear to be incompatible, but we show how lazy evaluation can be used to resolve this conflict, yielding amortized data structures that are efficient even when used persistently. Turning this relationship between lazy evaluation and amortization around, the notion of amortization also provides the first practical techniques for analyzing the time requirements of non-trivial lazy programs. \nFinally, our data structures offer numerous hints to programming language designers, illustrating the utility of combining strict and lazy evaluation in a single language, and providing non-trivial examples using polymorphic recursion and higher-order, recursive modules.", "year": "1998", "authors": ["Chris Okasaki"], "refs": ["https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Catenable-double-ended-queues-Okasaki/2370f7d4b0fa4895ac461bf43c06484719330a5b", "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Pure-versus-impure-Lisp-Pippenger/1f4747ef4934bbed9f2e0342e0f82c0a62cc306d", "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Statically-checkable-pattern-abstractions-F%C3%A4hndrich-Boyland/1211dc4b717ce53e3ef839324260de84e58e2d71", "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Purely-functional-lists-with-catenation-via-Kaplan-Tarjan/8bb1a723472f98ccc653595f9e513edae40c6a70", "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Purely-functional-representations-of-catenable-Kaplan-Tarjan/3a01b173aac9c156ab57ec0235fd11367783c7cc", "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Splaysort%3A-fast%2C-versatile%2C-practical-Moffat-Eddy/a22f961744d57cd3ad8c3ccc009848bc15b8b10a", "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/The-Definition-of-Standard-ML%3A-Revised-1996-Milner-Tofte/ced6a87b5a3822026722fb78bcf8733932bd08b3"]},

It is well known that cyclic list structures can be created by impure programs, but not by pure ones. In this sense, impure Lisp is \u201cmore powerful\u201d than pure Lisp. If the inputs and outputs of programs are restricted to be sequences of at ornic symbols, however, this difference in computability disappears. We shall show that if the temporal sequence of input and output operations must be maintained (that is, if computations must be \u201conline\u201d ), then a difference in complexity remains: for a pure program to do what an impure program does in n steps, O(n log n) steps are sufficient, and in some cases Q(n log n) steps are necessary.", "year": "1997", "authors": ["Nicholas Pippenger"], "refs": ["https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/On-pointers-versus-addresses-Ben-Amram-Galil/ba96d084f99e8181551b50a03257bb1fab0b7cf8", "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Recursive-Functions-of-Symbolic-Expressions-and-by-Carthy/decda49b97ff3846fae8accf238750eb2fed20c3"]}
